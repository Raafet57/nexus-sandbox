Enabling instant cross-border payments


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus Global Payments (NGP) is a multilateral payment scheme dedicated to transforming cross-border transactions in line with the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments targets of speed, cost, accessibility, and transparency.

This site contains detailed technical and functional information about Nexus, and is written for the payment system operators, banks, payment service providers and FX Providers who may be participating in Nexus.

*   If you are new to Nexus, we recommend starting with **chapter 2** of the [latest (2024) Nexus reportarrow-up-right](https://www.nexusglobalpayments.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Project-Nexus-Report-Phase-3.pdf)
     for an overview of the scheme & governance, business model and technology architecture of Nexus.
    

This site contains detailed **technical documentation,** covering:

*   [ISO 20022 message specifications](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-guidelines-excel)
     for Nexus
    
*   [API specifications](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/apis/overview)
    

circle-exclamation

Nexus is not yet operational, and the information on this site will be updated as the design of Nexus is refined and improved.

Over 100 countries already have instant (or "fast") payment systems that allow people to send money to each other within seconds. However, sending money abroad is often still slow and expensive. **Connecting these domestic payment systems internationally could improve the speed, cost and transparency of cross-border payments.**

**Nexus is designed to standardise the way that these systems connect to each other.** Rather than a payment system operator building custom connections for every new country that it connects to, the operator can make one connection to the Nexus platform. This single connection allows an instant payments system to reach all other countries in the network. Nexus could significantly accelerate the growth of instant cross-border payments

The Nexus blueprint has been developed over 3 years with significant input from instant payment system operators, central banks, commercial banks and payment service providers and FX providers who have a significant presence in FX markets and cross-border payments. We welcome further [feedback and suggestionsarrow-up-right](https://www.nexusglobalpayments.org/contact-us/)
 to enhance the blueprint.

Next steps for Nexus

Originally conceptualised and developed by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in collaboration with central banking partners, Nexus standardises the way instant payment systems (IPS) connect across countries.

To bring this vision to life, Nexus Global Payments (NGP) was established on March 26, 2025 by the central banks and IPS operators of India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. These pioneering jurisdictions form the inaugural cohort of Nexus owners provided the foundational capital to build and scale the platform. As we grow, we aim to welcome additional participants and owners, fostering a truly global and interoperable payment network. 

NGP is a not-for-profit organisation incorporated in Singapore, which is dedicated to managing the Nexus scheme and advancing the mission: to enable fast , efficient, and safe cross-border payments at scale. With NGP at the helm, Nexus has transitioned from a BIS-led initiative to an independent and collaborative effort, to shape the future of global payments.

# Scope of Nexus payments | Nexus Payments Docs

Nexus supports account-to-account payments between individuals (known as person-to-person (P2P) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C)) and businesses (B2B), or between individuals and businesses (P2B, B2P). These payments are initiated by the sender entering a proxy, such as a mobile number, or account details into the app of the Sender's PSP.

circle-exclamation

This guide does not yet cover payments that are initiated by scanning a QR code, including:

*   proxy payments, where the proxy is embedded in a QR code
    
*   “merchant payments”, eg payments from a customer to a retailer or other business, using dynamic QR codes at the point of sale (either physical or e-commerce).
    

These features will be added to Nexus in due course.

Nexus currently supports **Single Instant Cross-Border Cross-Currency Payments:**

_**“Single payment”**_

Nexus supports single payments only. A `pacs.008` payment instruction message sent to Nexus must only contain a single transaction. Nexus will process each payment individually and PSPs will accept/reject each Nexus payment individually.

circle-info

**Nexus does not accept bulk/batch payment instructions.** However, it is acceptable for a PSP to receive a bulk/batch payment file from its customers (or for an IPS to receive a bulk/batch payment file from its PSPs), “debulk” the file and submit the payments one-by-one as individual payments through Nexus. The Nexus Scheme Rulebook requirements will apply for these payments in full including requirements regarding transparency of fees, timelines and compliance checks. It will be the responsibility of the Source PSP (or IPS) to correlate the individual transactions (and their responses) back to the original batch/bulk file, if required.

_**“Instant”**_

Nexus processes instant payments. A _domestic_ instant payment is defined as a payment executed end-to-end, where the funds being transferred from the account of a Sender are made available in the account of the Recipient, irrevocably, within seconds (typically within 20 seconds). Nexus combines two _domestic_ instant payments into a cross-border instant payment.

**“Cross-Border, Cross-Currency”** Nexus is designed for instant payments requiring a currency conversion, using an FX Provider. See [FX Provision](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/key-points)
.

triangle-exclamation

Nexus does not currently support payments to and from the same currency (even if they are in different countries)

# Steps 1-2: Country, Currency & Amount | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-info

The rest of this section assumes that readers are familiar with the main actors in Nexus: Payment Service Providers (PSPs), Instant Payment System Operators (IPSOs), Foreign Exchange Providers (FXPs) and Settlement Access Providers (SAPs).

For a primer on each of these actors please see [Chapter 2.3 of the Nexus (2024) reportarrow-up-right](https://www.nexusglobalpayments.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Project-Nexus-Report-Phase-3.pdf)
.

The example user journey below demonstrates how an individual Sender would use their existing PSP channel (eg an app) to make a payment through Nexus, and describes the steps taken by Nexus behind the scenes.

circle-exclamation

Note that there is no "Nexus app" and payment Senders do not register with or interact directly with Nexus. The app shown is a mockup designed to give an example of how a PSP may integrate the service into their own app.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-1-2-country-currency-and-amount#toc116457912)

Step 1: Ask the Sender to select the country and currency

1.  Using data retrieved from the `GET /countries/` API operation, the Source PSP (Sender's PSP) can display a dropdown Countries list to the Sender via the Source PSP’s app or other channel. (Left and middle figure below.)
    
2.  The response to `GET /countries/` lists all Nexus-enabled countries and the currencies available in that country. If the Sender selects a country with more than one currency, the PSP should immediately:
    
    1.  Display a second form element (eg `<select>` or `<radio>`) that lists the currencies available (Right hand screen below.)
        
    2.  Ask the Sender to select the currency that the Recipient expects to receive
        
    
3.  The app should store the selected country (and currency, if applicable) in memory, as it will be required when retrieving FX quotes
    

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-f2843a0163f64ddddf830743acbc847f4cc56e7e%252FSlide1.PNG%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=da7202ab&sv=2)

Sender would first select the country that the payment is going to. If more than one currency is available in that country, they would also select the currency (right pane).

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-1-2-country-currency-and-amount#toc116457913)

Step 2: Ask the Sender to define EITHER the amount that should be sent, OR the amount that should be received

On the next screen, the PSP should now generate a form that will allow the user to define either:

*   The amount the Sender wishes to send (the `**DebtorAccountAmount**` which will be debited from the Sender/Debtor's account), OR
    
*   The amount the Sender wishes the Recipient to receive (the `**CreditorAccountAmount**` which will be credited to the Recipient/Creditor's account)
    

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-8abc16a85f069d50838440c9f8e566bcdda8b915%252FSlide2.PNG%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=771e6b20&sv=2)

The Sender would use their existing banking app to define either the amount they wish to send in their own currency, or the amount they wish the Recipient to receive, in the Recipient's currency.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-1-2-country-currency-and-amount#toc116457914)

Validating maximum transaction amounts in-app

Different IPSs have different limits on the maximum value of a transaction. The `GET /quotes/` API operation in Nexus will automatically apply these limits and inform the Source PSP if the requested amount exceeds the Source Currency Amount or Destination Currency Amount at a given exchange rate. However, the PSP can also use client-side validation (eg setting the `max` attribute of the HTML form input element) to cap the amounts that can be input:

*   The **Source Currency Amount** field (labelled “_You send_” in the example screen) can be capped to either:
    
    *   the maximum value of the IPS to which the PSP is connected to. (This should be known by the Source PSP; it could alternatively be retrieved by calling `GET /countries/{countryCode}/currencies/{currencyCode}/max-amounts` with the country code of the PSP’s home country.), OR
        
    *   the maximum value that the PSP is willing to send (if lower than the local IPS limit)
        
    
*   The **Destination Currency Amount** field (labelled “_They receive_” in the example screen) should be capped to the maximum defined in the response to `GET /countries` for the selected Destination Country.

Step 12: Ask Sender to review and confirm details

**The Source PSP should now ask the Sender to review all details before confirming the payment.**

The Nexus scheme has specific requirements on the minimum information that should be shown to the Sender, to ensure transparency around the costs and FX rates that will be applied to the payment. The Source PSP should display:

*   The **Source Currency Amount** – the amount that will be deducted from the Sender’s account
    
*   The **Destination Currency Amount** – the exact amount that will be credited to the Recipient’s amount
    
*   The **exchange rate** that will be applied. This is the effective exchange rate paid by the Sender - the ratio between the amount deducted from the Sender's account, and the amount that is ultimately credited to the Recipient's account (rather than the exchange rate paid by the Source PSP to the FXP). See [Transparency Requirements](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#toc163731038)
    
*   The **fees** that the Sender will be charged by the Source PSP.
    

See [Transparency Requirements](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#toc163731038)
 for further details.

Sender's payment reference

The PSP can also offer the Sender a field to add a message/reference to the payment, which will be visible to the recipient. This message can be stored in the `pacs.008` element `/Document/FIToFICstmrCdtTrf/CdtTrfTxInf/RmtInf/Strd/CdtrRefInf/Ref` . (The message field can alternatively be added at any other point in the flow.)

*   **Debtor** is the sender of the payment. In this document, the Debtor is referred to as _**Sender**_.
    
*   **Debtor Agent** is the PSP or bank that holds an account for the Debtor. In this document, the Debtor Agent is referred to as the _**Source PSP**_.
    
*   **Creditor** is the intended recipient of the payment. In this document, the Creditor is referred to as _**Recipient**_.
    
*   **Creditor Agent** is the PSP or bank that holds an account for the Recipient. The Creditor Agent is referred to in this document as the _**Destination PSP**_.
    
*   **Proxy** (also known as alias) is a piece of information, such as a mobile phone number, that can be associated with an account.
    
    *   We use the term **Proxy Directory** to refer to the database of proxies (aliases) and the accounts they are associated to, and **Proxy Directory Operator (PDO)** to refer to the operator of the Proxy Directory service (who may also be the same entity as the Instant Payment System Operator). No equivalent terminology exists in ISO 20022.

# Steps 3-6: Exchange Rates | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

This step only applies to Source PSPs that wish to use a third-party FX Provider. Source PSPs that hold funds in an account as a Settlement Access Provider in the Destination Country can define their own FX rate. See [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
 for detail.

As shown in [Step 2](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-1-2-country-currency-and-amount#toc116457913)
, the Sender can choose to set EITHER:

*   the amount to send in their own Source Currency. This is the `**DebtorAccountAmount**` which will be debited from the Sender/Debtor's account, defined in the Source Currency, OR
    
*   the amount the Recipient should receive, in the Recipient's own Destination Currency. This is the `**CreditorAccountAmount**` which will be credited to the Recipient/Creditor's account, defined in the Destination Currency
    

The quote request process is slightly different depending on which option the Sender chose.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-3-6-exchange-rates#toc116457915)

Step 3: Source PSP prepares quote request to Nexus


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The Source PSP should use the `GET /quotes` API operation to retrieve quotes. This API accepts the following values:
    
    1.  `Source Country`
        
    2.  `Source Currency`
        
    3.  `Destination Country`
        
    4.  `Destination Currency`
        
    5.  `Amount`
        
    6.  `Amount Currency` (ie the 3-letter code for the Source Currency or Destination Currency)
        
    
2.  If the Sender defined the `DebtorAccountAmount` (ie amount to send), then the Source PSP should set the following values in the quote request:
    
    1.  `Amount Currency` = `Source Currency`
        
    2.  `Amount` = `DebtorAccountAmount` **minus** `Source PSP Deducted Fee`
        
    

circle-info

If the Source PSP charges a _Source PSP Deducted Fee,_ this fee is deducted from the `DebtorAccountAmount` _before_ any funds are transfered to the FX Provider. Therefore the Source PSP should request the quote amount **after** deducting its own fee.

For further information on the _Source PSP Deducted Fee,_ see [Source PSP Fees](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#source-psp-fees)

1.  Alternatively, if the Sender defined the `CreditorAccountAmount` (ie amount the recipient should receive), then the Source PSP should set the following values in the quote request:
    
    1.  `Amount Currency` = `Destination Currency`
        
    2.  `Amount` = `CreditorAccountAmount`
        
    

circle-info

In this case, the Source PSP should request the amount defined by the Sender ie the CreditorAccountAmount. This is the exact amount that should be credited to the Recipient/Creditor account.

Nexus will work backwards from the CreditorAccountAmountto calculate how much money (in the Source Currency) the Source PSP needs to transfer to the FXP. This amount will also be sufficient to cover the `Destination PSP Deducted Fee`, so that the Recipient receives the full CreditorAccountAmount. See [Fees](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#destination-psp-deducted-fee)
 for further detail.

1.  The Source PSP sends a quote request to the `GET /quotes` API (see [APIs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/apis/overview)
    ).
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-3-6-exchange-rates#toc116457915-1)

Step 4: Nexus generates quotes


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Nexus will retrieve the basic rates for the currency and country pair selected, from those FXPs that have confirmed they are happy to provide FX to this Source PSP
    
2.  For each rate, **Nexus** will:
    
    1.  automatically apply any improvements offered by that FXP based on size of the transaction or the PSP requesting the rate. (See [Improving rates for larger transactions](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers/improving-rates-for-larger-transactions)
         and [Improving rates for specific PSPs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers/improving-rates-for-specific-psps)
         for more detail.)
        
    2.  **If the Sender defined the** `**DebtorAccountAmount**`, the Source PSP will have subtracted their own Destination PSP Deducted Fee and then requested a quote for the net amount - the `Interbank Settlement Amount` in the Source Currency. Nexus will multiply this amount by the (possibly improved) exchange rate to get the amount that will be transferred from the Destination SAP to the Destination PSP (the `Interbank Settlement Amount` in Destination Currency).
        
        1.  Nexus will also calculate the `Destination PSP Deducted Fee` and include this in the quote response.
            
        2.  Nexus will calculate the amount that will be credited to the Recipient's account after the `Destination PSP (Deducted) Fee` has been deducted. This is included the quote response as `CreditorAccountAmount`.
            
        
    3.  Alternatively, **if the Sender defined the** `**CreditorAccountAmount**`, Nexus will:
        
        1.  work backwards from this amount to calculate the `Destination PSP (Deducted) Fee`.
            
        2.  add the `CreditorAccountAmount` and `Destination PSP (Deducted) Fee` together, and divide the result by the (possibly improved) exchange rate to identify how much the Source PSP needs to transfer to the FXP. This amount will be included in the Quote response as `Interbank Settlement Amount` (in the Source Currency).
            
        
    4.  Nexus will check that the `Interbank Settlement Amount` (in the Source Currency) and `CreditorAccountAmount` (at the given rate) do not exceed the `MaxAmount` values in either the Source or Destination IPS
        
        1.  Where the Source Currency Amount or Destination Currency Amount provided by the Sender exceeds the `MaxAmt` of the respective IPS, Nexus will apply whichever cap is the smaller at the current rate, and include a flag `cappedToMaxAmount = true` in the quote response, which shows that the amount exceeded the cap. If this value is true, the `Interbank Settlement Amount` shown is the maximum that can successfully be sent through both IPSs at the current exchange rate.
            
        
    
3.  Nexus will then return the full list of adjusted and improved rates, with `Quote Id`s that are unique to this `GET /quotes` request. (The Quote Id of the chosen quote must be referenced when the PSP submits the `pacs.008` payment instruction in [Step 15: Send the pacs.008 to the Source IPS](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/step-13-16-set-up-and-send-the-payment-instruction#toc116457927)
    )
    

triangle-exclamation

The `GET /quotes`API must be called again every time the Sender changes either the Source Currency Amount or Destination Currency Amount, since changes in the transaction value may (a) breach the maximum transaction value or (b) qualify for different size-based improvements to the rate.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-3-6-exchange-rates#step-5-source-psp-selects-the-preferred-quote)

Step 5: Source PSP selects the preferred quote


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The Source PSP selects the quote that the PSP wishes to use (from any FXP with which is has already onboarded). This could be the best quote available or a quote from a preferred FX Provider.
    
2.  The PSP does not need to show the list of quotes to the Sender.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-3-6-exchange-rates#toc116457916)

Step 6: Source PSP displays the exchange rate and amounts to the Sender


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the exchange rate and Source Currency Amount and Destination Currency Amount can be shown to the Sender:

*   If the Sender defined the `DebtorAccountAmount` (ie the amount they wish to send, in their own currency), the amount fields should be updated as follows:
    
    *   `DebtorAccountAmount` = the DebtorAccountAmount originally defined by the Sender (ie no change)
        
    *   `CreditorAccountAmount` = the `CreditorAccountAmount` which was calculated by Nexus and provided in the Quote response;
        
    
*   If the Sender defines the `CreditorAccountAmount` (ie the amount that the Sender wishes the Recipient to receive),
    
    *   `DebtorAccountAmount` = the `Interbank Settlement Amount` (in Source Currency) provided in the quote response **plus** the _Source PSP (Deducted) Fee_
        
    *   `CreditorAccountAmount` = the `CreditorAccountAmount` which was originally defined by the Sender. (This will be the same as the `CreditorAccountAmount` included the quote response.)
        
    

circle-info

The Source PSP should check the quote response to confirm whether the amount originally requested by the Sender exceeded the maximum amount in either the Source IPS or Destination IPS.

If so, the Source PSP should update the app screen to show the new maximum value that can be sent.

*   The effective exchange rate applied should also be shown to the Sender

# Step 17: Accept the confirmation and notify Sender | Nexus Payments Docs

When the Destination PSP accepts the `pacs.008` payment instruction, they will respond with a `pacs.002` status report, which will be sent back to Nexus. Nexus will forward the `pacs.002` to the Source IPS, who will forward it to the Source PSP.

The `pacs.002` will have one of the following status codes (found in `/Document/FIToFIPmtStsRpt/TxInfAndSts/TxSts/`):

*   `**ACCC**`: the Destination PSP has accepted the payment and credited the Recipient’s account
    
    *   The **Source PSP should inform the Sender that the payment has successfully reached the Recipient**
        
    
*   `**RJCT**`: the Destination PSP payment has been rejected. A reason code may provide further information. In the Source IPS, any reservation of funds against the Source PSP has been cancelled and any movement of funds from the Source PSP to the Source Settlement Account Provider has been reversed.
    
    *   The **Source PSP should inform the Sender that the payment could not be made**.
        
    

If the **ACCC** message is received, the Sender should be notified (possibly through a notification or update on the app/online banking, or via an update to their statement).

# Step 13-16: Set up and send the payment instruction | Nexus Payments Docs

Now that the Sender has approved the payment, the PSP must set up the Nexus-standard `pacs.008` payment instruction (or domestic equivalent) and submit it to the local IPS.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/step-13-16-set-up-and-send-the-payment-instruction#toc116457924)

Step 13: Retrieve the Intermediary Agents (FXP’s accounts)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **The PSP uses the API operation** `**GET /quotes/{quoteId}/intermediary-agents**` **to retrieve the Intermediary Agents, based on the FX Quote ID of their preferred quote.** This information is used in the `pacs.008` message to specify the accounts held by the FX Provider in both the Source and Destination country. Funds will be paid into the FXP's account in the Source Country and paid out of the FXP's account in the Destination Country.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/step-13-16-set-up-and-send-the-payment-instruction#toc116457924-1)

Step 14: Construct the Nexus pacs.008 payment instruction


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **The PSP constructs the pacs.008 payment instruction:** this will make use of information from the earlier responses to:
    
    1.  `GET /quotes`
        
    2.  The `acmt.023` proxy or account resolution request
        
    3.  `GET /quotes/{quoteId}/intermediary-agents`
        
    
2.  The Source PSP should define whether the payment is to be sent as a normal priority payment (to be used for P2P payments) or a high priority payment (intended for P2M payments) by setting the Instruction Priority (`/Document/FIToFICstmrCdtTrf/CdtTrfTxInf/PmtTpInf/InstrPrty/`) as follows:
    
    1.  `**NORM**`: This is the default option. Nexus will wait on the response from the Destination IPS before confirming (or rejecting) to the Source IPS. This is the option that is supported by all IPSOs. Payments will be processed instantly, but in case of technical issues, the Destination IPSO maintains the final state of the payment.
        
    2.  `**HIGH**`: This is the option for urgent payments and physical point-of-sale payments (eg where the customer cannot leave the store until the payment is confirmed). If `HIGH` is used, Nexus will monitor the end-to-end processing time of the payment and will proactively reject the transaction in case no response is received in time from the Destination IPS. This will ensure the payment achieves a final status within the Maximum Execution Time at all times, but may lead to a slightly higher number of rejects. Not all IPSOs will be able to support high priority payments. Whether the Destination IPS supports high priority payments is part of the GET countries API response.

Step 15: Send the `pacs.008` to the Source IPS

1.  Once the Sender has confirmed the payment, the PSP should submit the `pacs.008` payment instruction to the Source IPS (using the same secure connection that the PSP normally use to submit domestic payment instructions to the IPS).
    
2.  The Source IPS will process the payment and then forward it to Nexus, following the process in [Payment Processing](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/key-points)
    .

**Checking for duplicated or fraudulent payments**

*   In general, Nexus expects the Source PSP to ensure that any payment instructions it sends to Nexus are legitimate, non-fraudulent and compliant with all applicable regulations, and should therefore be processed. It is therefore the responsibility of the Source PSP to defend against sending fraudulent payments or payments that were sent in error.
    
*   Nexus uses the **UETR (Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference)** to check whether a payment is unique. Nexus will check whether a payment with the same UETR has already been processed, and will not process duplicates.
    
*   However, Nexus will not check whether similar payments with different UETRs are possible duplicates. For example, if a Source PSP sends two payments, for the exact same amount, between the same sender and recipient accounts, but with different UETRs, Nexus will assume both payments are intentional and will process both.

# Steps 10-11: Sanctions screening | Nexus Payments Docs

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-10-11-sanctions-screening#toc113883511)

The sanctions screening requirement

All cross-border payments through Nexus will need to be screened by the PSPs involved in a payment against the sanctions lists that apply in their jurisdiction (‘sanctions screening’).

In most cases, sanctions screening software used by the PSP will first compare the name of the Sender or Recipient and look for similar names on the sanctions lists. If a positive ‘hit’ is found, the software can use additional data, such as address, date and place of birth, or national identity number, to confirm whether the Sender or Recipient is actually the person on the sanctions list or just a similar name (a “false positive”).

[FATF’s Recommendation 16arrow-up-right](https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/documents/fatf-40r/382-fatf-recommendation-16-wire-transfers)
 requires the following information to be included in cross-border payments:

SENDER

RECIPIENT

*   The name of account holder (Mandatory)
    
*   The account number
    
*   AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
    
    1.  Address
        
    2.  Place and date of birth
        
    3.  National ID number or another unique customer identification number
        
    

*   Account Number
    
*   Name
    

circle-info

Additional requirements may apply in each jurisdiction. For example, a particular country might define the Debtor > Postal Address element to be mandatory.

Each IPS can define this required information in Nexus so that it can be shared with PSPs in the response to `GET /countries`.

The PSP should therefore ensure that all `pacs.008` payment instructions to Nexus **include the Recipient’s name and account number as a minimum**. Adding further information in addition to the name will reduce the likelihood of the payment triggering a false positive alert and being delayed.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-10-11-sanctions-screening#toc113883511-1)

Step 10: Review the data available for sanctions screening; ask the Sender for Recipient data if necessary

The PSP should now review the `acmt.024` response to confirm whether:

*   Name is present
    
*   Account number is present
    

If the `Name` element is blank, the PSP **must** display a form asking the Sender for the Recipient’s full name. (The Recipient’s name is required as a minimum, in line with FATF Recommendation 16.)

triangle-exclamation

Failure to include the Recipient's name is likely to result in the payment failing the sanctions screening of PSPs and SAPs and the payment being rejected.

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-3eb98651ea9f58be159b7e1d1e6ba2fe32ba2e6d%252FSlide6.PNG%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=934223fc&sv=2)

If information about the Recipient can't be retrieved through either the proxy resolution or account resolution, the Source PSP will need to ask the Sender to provide that information.

The Source PSP can display fields for them to enter the Recipient’s address. The Source PSP should check the information it received from `GET /countries/{countryCode}/` to establish if these additional fields are mandatory in the Destination IPS.

Although the Source PSP could also ask for Date and Place of Birth and National Identity number, Recipients may be uncomfortable with sharing this information directly with the Sender. (In contrast, when the Destination PSP shares the information in response to an `acmt.023` account resolution request, the information is shared securely through Nexus and not shown to the Sender, except for the display name).

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-10-11-sanctions-screening#toc116457925)

Step 11: Screen the payment against applicable sanctions lists

Before the PSP send the payment instruction **the Source PSP will need to screen the Recipient against the sanctions lists applicable in the PSP’s jurisdiction**. (It is assumed that the Source PSP has already screened the Sender as part of the PSP’s regular KYC, AML and screening processes.)

circle-info

This step can be done later if the PSP's screening software requires a complete `pacs.008` payment instruction.

If the Destination PSP supports the `acmt.023/acmt.024` account resolution process, Nexus will already have issued a `acmt.023` request to the Destination PSP during the proxy and account resolution process.

# Steps 7-9: Addressing, Proxy Resolution & Confirmation of Payee | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-info

See [Addressing & Proxy Resolution](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/key-points)
 for further detail on how addressing is managed in Nexus.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-7-9-addressing-proxy-resolution-and-confirmation-of-payee#toc116457918)

7.1 App generates the addressing form

Next the Source PSP should provide the Sender with a form that allows them to select from the addressing formats available in the Destination Country and enter the proxy or PSP account details.

The form should first list the available proxy types, since these are usually easier for the Sender to input, followed by IBAN (if accepted), followed by any domestic account formats.

This form can be generated dynamically using the response to the `GET /countries/{countryCode}/address-types-and-inputs`. This API operation will return the list of proxy formats available in the destination country; this data can be used by the app to dynamically generate the form.

circle-info

The `address-types-and-inputs` API combines the results of two API operations into one response:

*   `GET /countries/{countryCode}/address-types`
    
*   `GET /address-types/{addressTypeId}/inputs`
    

A PSP could also choose to call the two APIs above independently to avoid retrieving data for address types that may not be selected by the Sender.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-7-9-addressing-proxy-resolution-and-confirmation-of-payee#toc116457919)

7.2 Sender selects an address type

The Source PSP should present the Sender the list of available address types, as shown below. The Sender can select the appropriate address type based on what information the Recipient has given them.

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-8d164e22a58414be56e062f0ed2be97c3f489a7a%252FSlide4.PNG%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=90230653&sv=2)

The Sender will select the type of proxy they were given, or local account number or IBAN, and then enter the details.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-7-9-addressing-proxy-resolution-and-confirmation-of-payee#toc116457920)

7.3 Sender enters addressing details

Each `addressType` is made up of one or more corresponding `input`s. For example, an IBAN only requires one input (the IBAN text itself) whereas a proxy will require both the proxy ID value itself (eg a mobile phone number) and the proxy type code (eg `MNBO`).

On the next screen, the Sender should be asked to enter the specific addressing details, depending on the option they selected before.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-7-9-addressing-proxy-resolution-and-confirmation-of-payee#toc116457921)

Step 8: PSP sends proxy or account details to Nexus


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Source PSP should now send the proxy or account details provided by the Sender as an ISO 20022** [**acmt.023**](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.023-identification-verification-request)
 **message.** This triggers the following steps:

1.  If a proxy is provided, **Nexus will send the proxy to the proxy lookup service** in the Destination Country. (The proxy lookup service will map the proxy to a financial institution identifier (eg BIC) and account number, or return an error if the proxy is not registered to an account.)
    
2.  Nexus will follow the steps outlined in [Proxy & Account Resolution Process](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/proxy-and-account-resolution-process)
     to contact the relevant proxy directory and/or Destination PSP.
    
3.  Nexus will respond to the Source PSP with:
    
    1.  the financial institution identifier
        
    2.  the account number
        
    3.  the Recipient’s full name, visible only to the Source PSP
        
    4.  the Recipient's display name, which can be shown to the Sender
        
    5.  any further personal data that is provided by the Proxy Directory or Destination PSP
        
    
4.  The current proxy lookup service via Nexus enables the Sender to provide a proxy, which will be resolved into account details, which are presented to the Sender for verification. Nexus will also support Verification of Payee, by allowing the Sender to input the details. This will be designed in a future phase.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-7-9-addressing-proxy-resolution-and-confirmation-of-payee#toc116457922)

Step 9: Ask Sender to Confirm Payee


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Source PSP should now ask the Sender to confirm that they recognize the Recipient’s name before proceeding with the payment.** This "confirmation of payee" or "verification of payee") step allows the Sender to verify that the holder of the Destination Account is actually the person or business they intend to pay. This provides a check against fraud as well as giving the Sender greater confidence that they entered the proxy or account details correctly.

circle-info

This process works when a proxy is used to address a payment. In some countries, particularly in Europe, confirmation of payee works differently. First the Sender is asked to provide the expected name of the Recipient, which is compared by the Destination PSP to the actual name they have on file. The Sender is then informed whether the actual name is matches the expected name, or is a close match, or not a match at all. This approach to confirmation of payee will be added to a future version of Nexus.

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-79a85780998bfedc4ca1c08bd37ba6f4b7ef90fe%252FSlide5.PNG%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=7196c75a&sv=2)

In most cases, the response to the `acmt.023` proxy or account resolution request will include the Recipient’s real name or a partially masked display name. This information is retrieved from either the proxy directory or the Destination PSP.

The Source PSP should show this to the Sender and ask them to confirm that this is the name they are expecting to see.

circle-exclamation

In some cases, the real name AND display name fields will both be blank. This can occur when:

The Destination PSP does not support the `acmt.023/acmt.024` process, **AND** either:

*   The proxy lookup service itself does not store or provide the account holder’s name or nickname **OR**
    
*   The Sender provided a local account number (so there was no proxy lookup)
    

In this situation, **there is no way for the Sender to confirm the identity of the Recipient** and this confirmation-of-payee step can be skipped. In such cases, the Sender must send the payment “blind” to the real identity of the account holder. **This may increase the risk of them making a payment to a fraudulent or mistaken account.**

This is one reason why it is always preferable to list the proxy options first in the addressing form, rather than IBAN or a local account number; most proxy schemes will return a name or nickname but it is possible that not all PSPs will support the account resolution process.)

# Overview of Payment Addressing in Nexus | Nexus Payments Docs

Nexus allows payments to be addressed using any details that are valid in the Recipient’s country. These could include:

*   **International Bank Account Numbers** (IBAN) (where used)
    
*   **Account Identification (account numbers)** alongside a Financial Institution Identification (such as BIC or a non-BIC _Clearing System Member Id_)
    
*   **Proxies** such as mobile phone number, email address or company registration number.
    

Nexus maintains a record of which payment address types are available in each country and provides this information to PSPs through the `GET /countries/{countryCode}/addressTypes` API operation.

circle-exclamation

Nexus will not provide its own proxy service or proxy format; users cannot register with Nexus to create a global “Nexus ID’.

Nexus does not maintain its own directory of proxies and associated accounts.

Benefits of using proxies instead of account details


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

circle-info

**Proxies are the preferred way to address Nexus payments**, as they are more user friendly and easier to enter on a mobile device. But Nexus will always support IBAN (where accepted) and Account Identifiers as well.

For Senders and Recipients of Nexus payments, the use of proxies improves the user experience:

*   **Easier to share details:** It is usually easier for the Recipient to share (for example) a phone number or email address than either (a) a Financial Institution Identification and Account Identification, or (b) an International Bank Account Number (which can be 20-32 characters).
    
*   **Reduces sharing of sensitive data:** A payment can be addressed to the Recipient without the Recipient having to share sensitive personal details, such as their home address, or reveal where they hold their accounts.
    
*   **Provides confirmation of payee:** Proxy directories typically provide some way of confirming the identity of the payee, for example, by returning the real verified name of the account holder (as provided by the account holder’s PSP). This helps to give the Sender confidence that they are sending funds to the correct account, as well providing a defence against fraud.

# Addressing via Proxies (Aliases) | Nexus Payments Docs

In many countries with instant payment systems (IPSs), payments can be addressed using “**proxies**” (or “aliases") in place of Account Identifications. A proxy (or alias) is any string of text that can be linked to a specific bank account. Commonly accepted proxies include:

*   Mobile phone numbers
    
*   Email addresses
    
*   National ID numbers
    
*   Company incorporation numbers
    

Nexus allows cross-border payments to be addressed using proxies. In principle, any proxy that is valid for domestic payments should also be valid for Nexus payments. (This is dependent on the relevant proxy service provider being onboarded and connected to Nexus.)

circle-exclamation

This guide assumes that each Instant Payment System has one – and only one – corresponding proxy directory. This is the case in most countries. However, in the euro area and the USA there may be multiple IPSs and multiple (often competing) proxy directories. This raises a number of complications that will be addressed in a future phase of development.

Different countries support different types of proxies. The table below shows some examples.

Addressing via IBAN


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Nexus supports addressing by International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) whenever the Destination Country accepts IBAN.** IBAN is accepted in around 78 countries, but is not accepted in many major markets (such as Canada, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, and the USA).

circle-exclamation

IBANs are **not accepted** in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

An IBAN is a single string of text that includes all the information needed to identify a target account. It is defined by the [ISO 13616arrow-up-right](https://www.iso.org/standard/81090.html)
 standard.

*   An IBAN can be up to 34 characters long
    
*   The first two letters define the country (eg US, GB, FR, DE)
    
*   The second two letters are check digits (a protection against typos)
    
*   The remaining digits define a “Basic Bank Account Number” which includes the Financial Institution Identification and an Account Identification.
    

An IBAN is a fixed length within a specific country, but can vary in length from country to country.

Addressing via Account Identification and Financial Institution Identification


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus also allows payments to be addressed using an `Account Identification` (commonly called “account numbers”) and a `Financial Institution Identification` (such as a Business Identifier Code, BIC or a non-BIC `Clearing System Member Id`). Nexus is aware of the format of the Account Identification and Financial Institution Identification.

**Identifying the Account**

Account Identifications can vary significantly in format and length from country to country. In some countries, all Account Identifications have a fixed length, but in other countries the Account Identification can vary in length depending on the financial institution.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/overview-of-payment-addressing-in-nexus/addressing-via-account-details#identifying-the-financial-institution)

**Identifying the Financial Institution**

The ISO 20022 standard permits three types of Financial Institution Identification:

*   Business Identifier Code (**BIC**) (most commonly used)
    
*   Legal Entity Identifier (**LEI**)
    
*   A domestic **Clearing System Member Identification**.
    

In some countries, financial institutions may have both a BIC _and_ a Clearing System Member Identification, although only one or the other needs to be used in a specific payment instruction.

LEI can be used in addition to BIC or Clearing System Member Identification to provide further information about the financial institution. This can be useful to support compliance checks and sanctions screening.

chevron-rightExplainer: Business Identifier Codes (BIC)[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/overview-of-payment-addressing-in-nexus/addressing-via-account-details#explainer-business-identifier-codes-bic)

BICs are defined by the [ISO 9362arrow-up-right](https://www.iso.org/standard/84108.html)
 standard and are issued by SWIFT. They are often referred to as a SWIFT Code, but are not restricted to SWIFT members or restricted to use on the SWIFT network.

A BIC defines a financial institution but not a specific account. Therefore, they must always be used in conjunction with an Account Identification.

*   A BIC can be either 8 or 11 digits (eg DBSSSGSG or DBSSSGSGXXX)
    
*   The 8-digit BIC (BIC-8) defines the country and financial institution

Each PSP is a member of an instant payment system, or “clearing system” in ISO 20022 terminology. The IPS will assign each member a unique ID. `Clearing System Member Identifications` are commonly known by local names, such as “routing number”, “sort code”, “bank-state-branch code” etc. Some examples of non-BIC Clearing System Member IDs are given below:

*   **Australia:** Bank-State-Branch (BSB) code, 6 digits (numeric)
    
*   **India:** Indian Financial System Code (IFSC), 11 characters (alphanumeric)
    
*   **Singapore:** BIC, 8 characters (alphanumeric)
    
*   **United Kingdom:** Sort code, 6 digits (numeric)
    
*   **USA:** Routing number, 9 digits (numeric)
    

triangle-exclamation

**Warning: Locally-generated, non-registered BICs**

Some IPSs issue non-bank PSPs with an identifier that follows the formatting of BIC but is not registered with Swift (the registration authority). This means that the locally-generated “pseudoBICs” are not included in the Swift database that some PSPs use to validate BICs before sending payments. Consequently, some PSPs may not be able to make payments to PSPs with non-registered pseudoBICs.

It is better to register these locally generated codes with Swift, so that they always validate correctly.

**This section describes:**

*   how Nexus payments can be addressed using any details that are valid in the Destination Country, including proxies/aliases, International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) or Account Identifiers.
    
*   how a Proxy Directory Operator (PDO) should onboard with Nexus, and the information it needs to provide about the proxy types available in that country
    
*   how a Source PSP should set up proxy or account resolution requests
    
*   how a PDO should process and respond to proxy resolution requests
    
*   how a Destination PSP should respond to account resolution requests

60-Second Summary


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Addressing:** Nexus payments can be addressed using the same details that are valid for domestic payments, including:
    
    *   IBAN (depending on the country)
        
    *   Account Identifiers in conjunction with a Financial Institution Identification (either a BIC or a non-BIC `Clearing System Member Identification`, such as a routing number)
        
    *   Proxies (also known as aliases) such as mobile numbers, email addresses or company registration numbers (depending on the country)
        
    
*   **Address Options & Address Inputs:** A Source PSP (ie the sender’s PSP) can use the Nexus APIs to find out which address options (including proxies) are available in each country. Once the Sender has selected the Destination Country, the PSP’s app can call the relevant Nexus API and use the data returned to dynamically generate the addressing form in the app.
    
*   **Proxy resolution:** Nexus connects to proxy directories in each country in the network. When a Sender provides a proxy (eg mobile number) for the Recipient, this will be sent through Nexus to the relevant proxy directory in the Recipient’s country. The proxy directory will reply with the Account Identification (account number) and Financial Institution Identification of the Recipient’s account.
    
*   **Account resolution:** Nexus will also try to contact the Destination PSP (ie the recipient’s PSP) to request further information about the Recipient. The Destination PSP can choose whether or not to share any further information. Any information shared can increase the chances that sanctions screening and other compliance checks will pass without requiring manual intervention.
    
*   **Onboarding and setup:** The Proxy Directory Operator (or IPSO, if the IPSO also operates the proxy directory) must inform Nexus of the address types available in its country when it first onboards to Nexus. It can do so through the Nexus Service Desk or through Nexus APIs.
    
*   **ISO 20022 and message translation:** Nexus uses ISO 20022 messages (specifically [`acmt.023`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.023-identification-verification-request)
     and [`acmt.024`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.024-identification-verification-report)
    ) for proxy and account resolution requests and responses. Where an IPS or its member PSPs do not support these messages domestically, the IPSO is responsible for translating the domestic message to the Nexus standard and vice versa.
    
*   **Local implementation:** In most countries, some changes may be needed to the domestic message format and the way that PSPs set up proxy resolution or account resolution requests.

# List of PSPs | Nexus Payments Docs

Nexus provides an API operation that returns a list of PSPs in a specific country along with their corresponding Financial Institution Identifications:

`GET` /countries/{countryCode}/fin-insts/psps

This can be used to generate a drop-down `**<select>**` menu item that allows the user to select the name of the PSP rather than entering the BIC manually.

This is useful for countries (such as the Philippines) that require the financial institution to be identified when using a proxy, or for countries (such as Singapore) where the convention is for the Recipient to share the full name of their PSP rather than the BIC.

circle-info

For usability, PSP app developers should enable the type-ahead feature that allows the user to start typing the PSP name to filter the list.

Using with Account Id


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An account ID (`_ACCT_`) only specifies the account, not the financial institution that holds that account. Therefore when the `_ACCT_` address type is selected, the Account Identification must always be used in conjunction with one of the `Financial Institution Identification` types in the table below.

circle-info

When the address type is ACCT, the response from the `Address Inputs` API will automatically include a field for the Financial Institution Identification.

In some countries, such as the Philippines, the same proxy can be registered to multiple financial institutions. Therefore it is necessary to collect the Financial Institution Identification for the Recipient.

# Obligations of PSPs using the Proxy Directory | Nexus Payments Docs

The obligations of PSPs when using the proxy directory are defined in the Nexus Rulebook. In particular:

*   **Appropriate use of the service:** The Source PSP is obliged to only send proxy resolution requests for the purpose of initiating a payment. However, the Source PSP is not obliged to complete a payment after initiating a proxy resolution (for example if the Sender decides not to proceed with the payment).
    
*   **Restricted use of the data:** When data is returned in response to a proxy resolution request, the PSP must use that data only for the purpose of processing this transaction, and not for any other purpose.
    
*   **Confirmation of payee:** Where the Recipient’s name is provided to the Source PSP (by the Proxy Directory or Destination PSP), the Source PSP must display this name to the Sender before they confirm the payment. This provides the Sender with greater confidence that they are sending funds to the correct account and reduces the chance of the proxy being used for fraud.
    
*   **Prevention of abuse:**
    
*   The Source PSP should monitor the number of proxy resolution requests a specific Sender makes to ensure that they are not ‘phishing’ for account details. At a basic level, this may involve imposing a timeout for the user if they look up, for example, five different proxies in a short period without initiating a payment (ie a rate limit on proxy resolution requests).
    
*   When sending acmt.023 proxy or account resolution requests, the Source PSP **should** include an unique Identification for the Sender which will allow the Proxy Directory Operator to identify whether multiple requests are initiated by the same individual in short succession. See [Messaging & Translation](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/key-points)
     for the correct placement of this Identification.

# Address Inputs | Nexus Payments Docs

In Nexus, each **address** _**type**_ includes **one or more address** _**inputs**_**.** For example:

*   An IBAN has only one address input (the `_IBAN_` field), because the IBAN itself combines information about the country, Financial Institution Id and Account Id.
    
*   An `_ACCT_` will require two inputs: the Account Identification itself, plus a Financial Institution Identification such as a BIC (`BICFI`) or non-BIC `Clearing System Member Id`, such as sort code, routing number etc.
    
*   A proxy normally requires only one input – the proxy identifier (such as a mobile phone number)
    

circle-exclamation

In some cases, such as the Philippines, a Financial Institution Identification must also be provided for each proxy (as the same proxy may be registered to multiple financial institutions in the Philippines).

The Nexus APIs provide a list of the address inputs in a format that can be used by a PSP’s client application to dynamically generate the addressing form. Each input is defined in terms that are agnostic to programming frameworks (eg they are similar to common HTML attribute definitions), as shown in the table below.

The Nexus APIs also return some “hidden” inputs such as the account type code. These are fixed (ie not set by the Sender) and inform the Source PSP’s app how the address type should be processed. In some cases, the hidden information must be included in the `acmt.023` message (such as the address type code when a proxy is used).

Text

Same as the Address Type code or Financial Institution Identification Type code above. E.g. _MNBO, ACCT, IBAN_

This code can be mapped to the app user’s language.

Title

Map, where key is the 2-letter language code (eg “en”) and the value is the explanatory title

Further description that can be used to guide the Sender, to be used in a tooltip or explanatory text below the input form.

A description in English (“en”) should always be provided. PDOs may choose to add additional languages based on the likely language of Senders to that country. (For example, countries may wish to add the languages of their closest trading partners and remittance corridors.)

For example, for a proxy type NIDN (National Identify Number) for Singapore, the description may be “NRIC/FIN” – two national identity number types)

Attributes

Name

ENUM: accountIdOrProxyId, addressTypeCode, finInstId

Suggested name of the form element that takes the input from the Sender. (Note: addressTypeCode would be a hidden input that is not visible to the Sender.)

Note: this is NOT the name of the input type that should be shown to the Sender – for that, see Label.Code

Type

Valid HTML input “type” attribute

Describes the type of HTML input element, eg text, tel, number, email

Pattern

Regular expression

Used to validate the form. (For email, this should be null, relying on the browser or app’s default email validation instead.)

Placeholder

Text

An example value that can optionally be shown in the input element before the Sender begins to enter information

Required

true/false

Whether this input is required or optional. (Currently all inputs are set to required. Optional inputs may be used in cases where a comparison model of account resolution is used, in which the Sender can optionally provide information about the Recipient that would be compared by the Destination PSP against their own verified records.)

ISO 20022 Path

(Code of the message type without the dot e.g. “_acmt024”)_

Text

The XPath to the position in an ISO 20022 message where this information can be used. Multiple message types may be specified, depending on whether proxy resolution is required first, or whether the input can be used directly in the pacs.008 payment instruction.

**NB:** The message name is defined without the period/dot character “.”, because the dot character is used in JavaScript to refer to properties of a JSON object (eg “attributes.name”).

# Obligations on the Proxy Directory Operator | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/role-of-the-proxy-directory-operator-pdo/obligations-on-the-proxy-directory-operator#toc163730935)

Obligations of the Proxy Directory Operator

When the PDO is enabled through Nexus, the PDO needs to fulfil the following obligations:

**Availability**

*   The PDO should have the ability to process proxy resolution requests, with the required availability (in principle 24/7/365), and with business continuity arrangements.
    
*   The PDO should maintain availability of at least 99.5%.
    

**Accuracy**

*   The PDO verifies, before a proxy can be shared through Nexus, that the proxy is in control of the account holder (i.e. payee), or otherwise authorized by the possessor of the proxy to link it to the Recipient’s account. The PDO guarantees that the proxy database will be kept current and changes made by proxy holders will be processed immediately.
    
*   The PDO is obligated to verify that the account holder name provided by the service is accurate (for example, by only allowing changes to the name associated to the proxy to be made by the PSP providing that account, rather than by the person controlling the proxy itself).
    

**Data privacy and consent**

*   The PDO needs to ensure that all required consents have been collected for any information disclosed to and via Nexus. The method to do this should be compliant with local standards where the information is collected.
    
*   The PDO will ensure that (contractual and implicit) privacy expectations of end users (both on the sending and receiving end of transactions) are met.
    

**Compliance**

*   The PDO will keep track of queries processed for the purpose of providing an audit trail to relevant parties involved.
    
*   The PDO establishes a secure channel with the Nexus Gateway for the protection of sensitive data.

# Role of the Proxy Directory Operator (PDO) | Nexus Payments Docs

In most IPS, a proxy (or "alias") cannot be used directly in a payment instruction (such as ISO 20022 [`pacs.008`arrow-up-right](https://github.com/bis-ih-fusse/nexus-temp/blob/main/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer)
). Instead, the proxy must first be sent to the local **proxy directory**, via a proxy resolution request. The proxy directory service will then lookup and return the corresponding account details.

**Proxy Directory Operators (PDOs)** provide and maintain the databases which contain a list of proxies and the accounts and FIs that each proxy is associated with.

PDOs typically provide:

*   A **database of proxies** and associated Financial Institution Identifications and Account Identifications
    
*   A method for account holders to **register and deregister proxies**, or change the account linked to a specific proxy, via their authorized PSPs
    
*   A method for PSPs to make a **proxy resolution request** to the proxy directory (ie sending a proxy and receiving back a Financial Institution Identification, Account Identification and name of the account holder)
    

circle-info

In many countries (but not all), the PDO is the same entity as the Instant Payment System Operator (IPSO), and therefore the instant payment _scheme_ and proxy resolution _scheme_ are managed by the same entity, and the PDO and IPSO are the same entity.

*   The Proxy Directory or Destination PSP **may** also share a ‘display name’, which could be the full name (unmasked) or the full name partially masked.
    
    *   This should be provided in the `_IdVrfctnReq/Rpt/UpdtdPtyAndAcctId/Acct/Nm_` element of the `acmt.024` message.
        
    
*   **The Proxy Directory or Destination PSP is responsible for masking the name** according to their own privacy and data protection preferences, policies or local regulations.

# Step 4: Source PSP processes the results | Nexus Payments Docs

The Source PSP will now receive an `acmt.024` response message from Nexus.

1.  The Source PSP will check the `acmt.024` to see if the proxy or account resolution has been successful.
    
    *   If the proxy or account resolution has **failed**, the Source PSP will display the reason to the Sender, based on the _Reason Code_ provided. (For example: “_This proxy is not associated with any account.”_)
        
    
2.  If the proxy resolution is **successful**, the Source PSP must:
    
    1.  Check if the display name is provided in the `acmt.024` response message (in the `Account > Name` element):
        
        1.  **If a display name is provide**, the Source PSP should the display name to the Sender and ask them to confirm that this is the name they’re expecting to see (see [Step 9 of the User Journey](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/steps-7-9-addressing-proxy-resolution-and-confirmation-of-payee#toc116457922)
            ).
            
        2.  **If no display name is provided**, the app should show the Sender a warning to the effect of “We were unable to check the name of the account holder. Please double-check the account details are correct before sending the payment.” The Sender may proceed with the payment at their own discretion.
            
        
    

triangle-exclamation

If no real name was provided in `_Party > Name_`_,_ the Source PSP does not have sufficient information about the Recipient to complete the necessary compliance and sanctions screening checks.

In this case, the Source PSP **must** ask the Sender to provide this information. (This is the least preferred outcome as it relies on potentially inaccurate information from the Sender, rather than verified information from the Destination PSP or Proxy Directory.)

# Address Types | Nexus Payments Docs

In Nexus, each **address type** is defined by an ISO 20022 code:

*   **Account details** will be described with the code `_IBAN_` (for IBAN) or `_ACCT_` (for Account Identifications).
    
*   If `ACCT` is used, it will be necessary to also collect a `Financial Institution Identification` alongside the Account Identification. The `Address Inputs` API informs PSPs what information that needs to be collected.
    
*   **Proxies** are defined by the ISO 20022 `ExternalProxyAccountType1Code`, taken from the [ISO 20022 External Code Setarrow-up-right](https://www.iso20022.org/catalogue-messages/additional-content-messages/external-code-sets)
    

The table below lists the possible address type codes in Nexus. The most commonly accepted address types are bolded.

circle-info

Even IPS that use ISO 20022 domestically often use proprietary codes to describe proxies, for example, using "MSISDN" rather than the ISO 20022 "MBNO". There are particular translation challenges to consider around the use of proxy code - please see [Translating To/From ISO 20022 Codes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translating-to-from-iso-20022-codes)

 and [`**acmt.024**`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.024-identification-verification-report)
 for all communication related to proxy resolution or account resolution.

**The remainder of this guide assumes that the IPS operator, proxy directory and member PSPs can support the** `**acmt.023 & acmt.024**` **messages according to the Nexus usage guidelines.** However, this is not the case in many countries.

IPSOs that do not currently support `acmt.023` and`acmt.024` must either:

*   translate these messages to the relevant domestic format, or
    
*   adapt their systems (including the proxy directory, and the systems of their member PSPs) to support these messages.
    

These options and the translation process are described in [Messaging & Translation](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/key-points)
.

High level flow diagram showing the proxy and account resolution process in Nexus

1.  A Sender can enter either the Recipient’s proxy ID or account ID into their PSP’s app
    
2.  The Source PSP will send this information to Nexus
    
3.  If the Sender provided a proxy, Nexus will connect to the relevant proxy directory and request the corresponding account details
    
    1.  The proxy directory will return the corresponding account details.
        
    
4.  If either (a) the Sender provided an account ID, or (b) the proxy resolution response from the Proxy Directory includes the account ID, Nexus will:
    
    1.  Check if the Destination PSP is able to accept account resolution requests.
        
        1.  If so, Nexus will send an account resolution request to the Destination PSP
            
        
    
5.  Nexus will combine the information from the proxy directory and the Destination PSP (if an account resolution request was sent), and send this back to the Source PSP
    
6.  The Source PSP will check the information in the response:
    
    1.  If a Display Name was provided, the Source PSP will ask the Sender to confirm that the payee is who they expect
        
    2.  If no Display Name is provided, the Sender will be advised to proceed with the payment at their own risk
        
    3.  If no other information is provided (such as the full name on the account), then the Source PSP will need to ask the Sender to provide this information so that the Source PSP can perform compliance and sanctions screening checks on the Recipient.
        
    

The rest of this section covers those steps in more detail.

# Onboarding a Proxy Directory Operator onto Nexus | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/role-of-the-proxy-directory-operator-pdo/onboarding-a-proxy-directory-operator-onto-nexus#toc163730933)

The PDO must provide Nexus with reference data on the available address types and input fields


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus needs to be aware of the different [address types](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/address-types-and-inputs/address-types)
 (such as IBAN, account, mobile) and [address inputs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/address-types-and-inputs/address-inputs)
 available in each country, so that it can provide this information to Source PSPs through the Nexus APIs. Therefore, when a new IPSO (or proxy service) is onboarded with Nexus, the IPSO must provide Nexus with reference data describing each address type and the input fields (address inputs) for that address type. This information can be provided via the Nexus Service Desk or APIs.

The IPS Operator is responsible for ensuring that the data is kept up to date.

PDO must onboard with the local IPS Operator


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Nexus Scheme expects the IPS Operator to take on the responsibility for connecting its instance of the Nexus Gateway to the domestic proxy directory, particularly where:

*   The IPS Operator and the PDO are the same entity, AND/OR
    
*   In each country that the IPS Operator provides payment services to, there is only one PDO
    

circle-exclamation

Cases where there are multiple IPSOs or multiple Proxy Directories in a particular country or jurisdiction may need to be handled differently. The approach to this scenario will be developed in a future phase of Nexus development.

# Step 2: Proxy Resolution Messaging Sequence | Nexus Payments Docs

Following on from [Step 1](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/proxy-and-account-resolution-process/step-1-sender-inputs-proxy-or-account-details)
, assuming the Sender entered a proxy, the Source PSP will send Nexus an ISO 20022 [`acmt.023`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.023-identification-verification-request)
 message that includes the proxy details.

**1\. Nexus (Message Transformation)**

Nexus will:

*   look for the Country Code in the `_Assignee > Agent > PostalAddress > Country_` element
    
*   identify the relevant proxy directory in that country, and
    
*   update the Assignee to the BIC of the proxy directory (or its parent IPS Operator). This is the only change that is made to the message.

**2\. Nexus -> Destination Proxy Directory**

Nexus will send the proxy resolution request to the Destination Proxy Directory Operator.

The message will be formatted as an ISO 20022 `acmt.023` message. The PDO must be able to accept the message in this format. If the _domestic_ proxy resolution message format is different, the **IPSO is responsible for translating the message** from the Nexus `acmt.023` to the domestic format message before processing the proxy resolution request (See [Messaging & Translation](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/key-points)
 for further details.)

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/proxy-and-account-resolution-process/step-2-proxy-resolution-messaging-sequence#scenario-1-no-associated-proxy)

**Scenario 1: No associated proxy**

The Destination Proxy Directory should first check if the proxy is associated with an account.

If there is no associated account, the proxy directory should respond with an `acmt.024` response including the appropriate error code in the `_Report > Verification > Reason > Code_` element. (See [Error codes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.024-identification-verification-report#toc143525641)
 for further information.)

#### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/proxy-and-account-resolution-process/step-2-proxy-resolution-messaging-sequence#scenario-2-proxy-successfully-resolved)

**Scenario 2: Proxy successfully resolved**

If the proxy successfully maps to an account, the proxy directory should prepare and return an `acmt.024` response message that contains, **at a minimum:**

*   Account details, in the form of either:
    
    *   an **IBAN**, OR
        
    *   the **Financial Institution Identification** (eg BIC) AND the **Account Identification** of the linked account
        
    
*   the **real name** associated with the account (wherever possible) – this will be used by the Source PSP when sanctions screening the Recipient.
    
    *   This should be stored in the element `_UpdatedPartyAndAccountIdentification > Party > Name_`_._
        
    *   Note that wherever possible, the full real name should be returned, as this information supports accurate and automated sanctions screening.
        
    
*   a **display name** that can be shown to the Sender to allow them to confirm that the account holder is the intended Recipient. This could be the full name (where privacy and data protection rules allow this to be shown to the Sender) or a partially obscured name, depending on the proxy service.
    
    *   This value should be in the element `_UpdatedPartyAndAccountIdentification > Account > Name_`
        
    

circle-exclamation

Note: this is a non-standard use of the _Account > Name_ element_,_ which should normally describe the name of the _account_ rather than the name of the account holder. Unfortunately, the `acmt.024` message structure does not currently have a dedicated element for a display name that can be shown to the Sender but which may be different from the real account holder name.

The proxy directory should send this response back to the Nexus.

See [**Step 3**](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/proxy-and-account-resolution-process/step-3-account-resolution-messaging-sequence)
 below for details on how Nexus will handle this response.

Flow diagram for setup of the addressing form in the Source PSP's app

1.  When the Sender selects the Destination Country for a payment in their PSP’s app, the Source PSP will call the `GET /countries/{countrycode}/addressTypes` API operation, specifying the country code. Nexus will respond with a full list of address types for that country, including any proxy types, Account Identification formats and/or IBAN. (See [_Address Types_](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/address-types-and-inputs/address-types)
     for details.)
    
2.  The Source PSP will show the Sender a form allowing them to select one of the possible address types, according to the details they were given by the Recipient.
    
3.  The Sender selects an address type (eg the “Mobile” option on the form; in the case of a payment to Singapore, this would select the address type with the ID “_SGMBNO”_).
    
4.  The Source PSP will call the `GET /addressTypes/{addressTypeId}/inputs` API operation to retrieve the input fields that are required for this address type.
    

circle-info

The Source PSP could retrieve the address inputs for all address types in a single API call by using `GET /countries/{countryCode}/addressTypesAndInputs/` instead of `GET /countries/{countryCode}/addressTypes/`

1.  The Source PSP’s app will use the address inputs to generate the app form to enter the address details
    
2.  The Sender will enter the details that they were given by the Recipient (eg “+6580001234”).
    
3.  The Source PSP’s app must validate that the address details entered by the Sender are in the correct format. These validation rules will be provided as regular expressions (regex) in the address inputs information provided by Nexus. This allows the PSP to validate the format of the data in-app, prior to any communication with Nexus or the proxy scheme.
    
4.  If the Sender entered **proxy details**, the Source PSP will prepare an ISO 20022 [`acmt.023`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.023-identification-verification-request)
     message, following the **usage guidelines for** **proxy resolution.** The Source PSP will send the `acmt.023` (or equivalent API request) to Nexus.
    
    1.  **See** [**Step 2**](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/proxy-and-account-resolution-process/step-2-proxy-resolution-messaging-sequence)
         for further steps on proxy resolution.
        
    
5.  If the Sender entered account details, the Source PSP will prepare an **ISO 20022** [**acmt.023**](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.023-identification-verification-request)
     message, following the **usage guidelines for** **account resolution.** The Source PSP will send the `acmt.023` (or equivalent API request) to Nexus.

# Step 3: Account Resolution Messaging Sequence | Nexus Payments Docs

At this step, Nexus has access to account details for the Recipient, from one of two sources:

*   An `acmt.023` message from the Source PSP, which includes the Account Identification and Financial Institution Identification provided by the Sender, OR
    
*   An `acmt.024` response from the Destination Proxy Directory, which includes the account details associated with the proxy provided by the Sender.
    

If the Destination PSP is enabled to process `acmt.023` requests, Nexus will send an updated `acmt.023` to the Destination PSP to get verified information about the Recipient directly from the Destination PSP, as follows.

circle-info

Supporting account resolution is optional for each PSP, and Nexus would be aware of which PSPs are willing and able to support account resolution requests. Nexus would not send account resolution requests to PSPs that are unable to process them.

**1\. Nexus**

Nexus will:

*   look for the Agent Id in the `_Agent > FinancialInstitutionId_` element
    
*   check whether that Agent is reachable through Nexus
    
    *   If not, Nexus will prepare an `actm.024` with the `_Report > Verification_` element set to “false” (since it is not possible to proceed with the payment) and the appropriate _Reason_ code (`_AGNT_`_,_ Incorrect Agent – see [Error codes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.024-identification-verification-report#toc143525641)
        ).
        
    
*   check whether the Agent is able to process account resolution requests. (Not all PSPs will be able to; this information will be recorded by Nexus when a new PSP is onboarded.)
    
*   If the Destination PSP **can** accept account resolution requests, Nexus will:
    
    *   update the Assignee for the message to the Destination PSP
        
    *   forward the `acmt.023` request message to the Destination PSP (via the IPS that is connected to that Agent).
        
    
*   If the Destination PSP **cannot** accept account resolution requests:
    
    *   If the Sender originally provided a proxy, Nexus will forward the `acmt.024` that was received from the Destination Proxy Directory in [Step 2](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/proxy-and-account-resolution-process/step-2-proxy-resolution-messaging-sequence)
        
    *   If the Sender originally provided account details, Nexus will prepare an `acmt.024` with the _Report > Verification_ element set to “false” (since account resolution was not possible) and the appropriate _Reason_ code (proposed to be `_AB08_` _– Offline Creditor Agent_).

**2\. Destination PSP**

The Destination PSP should use the account ID provided to look up the corresponding account.

*   If the **account does not exist or is inactive**, they should return an `acmt.024` with the `_Report > Verification_` element set to “false” and the appropriate `_Reason_` code (such as `AC01`, `AC04`, `AC06` – see [Error codes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.024-identification-verification-report#toc143525641)
    ).
    
*   If the **account is active**, they should prepare an acmt.024 response and add (to the `_UpdatedPartyAndAccountIdentification_` block) the following information:
    
    *   the **real name** associated with the account (wherever possible) – this will be used by the Source PSP when sanctions screening the Recipient.
        
        *   This should be in the element `_UpdatedPartyAndAccountIdentification > Party > Name_`

In addition, if the Destination PSP can supply some or all of the following information will support more efficient sanctions screening, with fewer false positive alerts:

*   Address
    
*   Date and Place of Birth
    

*   The Destination PSP should now prepare an `acmt.024` response and send it to Nexus. The flow diagram below explains how the Destination PSP should prepare the message.

In some jurisdictions, PSPs will be unwilling to share any information about the Recipient/Creditor before a payment is initiated. In this case, an alternative form of verification (often used in Europe) is to ask the Sender to provide information about the Recipient, and then ask the Destination PSP to confirm whether or not that information is accurate. This "**comparison"** or **"matching"** process will be developed for Nexus in a future phase of development.

The FXP’s counterparty is the Source PSP to whom they sell the Destination Currency, and the FXP does not deal with (or have information on) the Sender or Recipient.

However, when an FXP is a member of an IPS and therefore acts as SAP to themselves, the entity _is_ responsible for screening the payment against applicable sanctions lists in their role as SAP, subject to local regulations. (See [Settlement Access Provision](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/key-points)
.)

Minimum commitment


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FXPs must commit to providing FX to Nexus for a certain minimum duration (to be specified in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook) and must give a period of notice if they wish to stop providing FX.

FXPs may choose to permanently withdraw from providing FX to Nexus.

The Nexus Scheme Rulebook defines the process and minimum notice period for withdrawing from the scheme.

Market maker role


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, FX Providers are expected to play a similar role to that of a market maker; this means that they are expected to always provide a quote for the payment corridors that they provide. If they do not wish to be committed for new payments, they may set a quote that is below the rest of the market, but they should not “exit the market” by providing no quote at all.

This expectation is necessary to ensure that there is always liquidity available for Nexus payments and to avoid a situation where all FX Providers for a currency channel choose to “sit out” of the market (making payments through that channel impossible). The obligation to always quote also helps to ensure that FX rates will be dynamic and are likely to be broadly in line with other FX markets.

An exception may need to be made for FXPs who do not have the technical capacity to quote 24/7. For example, some FXPs who do not have a global presence may only be able to quote in their country’s business hours. In this case, they would be expected to always provide active rates during their business hours but would be able to “exit” the market by withdrawing all their rates at the end of the business day. Over time and as they gain experience with Nexus payment flows, such FXPs should be able to develop the ability to automate rate provision and liquidity management outside of business hours, in order to start quoting 24/5 (Mon-Fri) and ultimately 24/7 (including weekends).​

# Revenue model for FXPs | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

This page relates **only** to third-party FX Providers.

For Source PSPs that provide their own FX, a different process applies. See [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
 for details.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/revenue-model-for-fxps#toc163809581)

Revenue model for FXPs

As described in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook, FXPs are not permitted to:

*   make a deduction from the value of a Nexus payment as it flows through the FXP's accounts, or
    
*   charge a separate fee (“Invoiced Fee”) to PSPs for the FX service they provide.
    

Therefore FXPs must set the exchange rates they offer via Nexus at a level that provides for all their own costs plus their expected profit margin.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/revenue-model-for-fxps#toc163809582)

Costs incurred by FXPs

Key costs incurred by FX Providers will include:

*   The initial technical cost incurred by the FXP to integrate with Nexus
    
*   The costs of acquiring a particular currency (either purchased via wholesale FX markets, or borrowed, for example if the SAP provides the FXP with a line of credit)
    
*   The costs charged by Settlement Access Providers for account provision (if the FPX is not a member of the IPS in question)
    
*   All other costs of operation, onboarding PSPs, regulatory compliance etc.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/revenue-model-for-fxps#toc163809583)

Ensuring a competitive FX market

Nexus is designed to ensure a competitive FX market:

*   **FX Providers are in competition with each other** to provide the best exchange rates for a given currency pair.
    
*   **PSPs have free choice over which FXP they use** (subject to the requirement that the PSP has completed the initial KYC and onboarding process with that FXP - see [Onboarding PSPs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/onboarding-psps)
    )
    
*   When an FXP posts a quote to Nexus, they are informed of the **current leading market rate** for that corridor (but not the FXP offering that rate), so they can assess whether the rates they offer are competitive against the market as a whole.
    

To have competitive pricing, there needs to be **more than one FX Provider for a specific corridor.** Without this, the sole FX Provider will have a monopoly on that corridor. Rates in a monopoly corridor will be less competitive, although users could switch to using other payment methods, so there is still some pressure on the FXP to offer rates broadly in line with the wider FX market.

circle-exclamation

The API credentials given to third-party FXPs will not allow them to use the `GET /quotes/` API and so they are unable to see the full breakdown of rates offered by their competitor FXPs.

FXPs who are also PSPs will have two separate sets of API credentials and must not share the information from the `GET /quotes/` response between the payments and FX/Treasury departments.

Address types


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is an example description of the **address types** for Indonesia. Please note the following:

*   `id` would be automatically generated by the database. (In this example, human-readable IDs are given based on the country code and address type.)
    
*   `code` defines the address type code
    
*   `displayOrder` describes the order in which the relevant Proxy Directory Operator (PDO) recommends listing the address types when they are shown to the Sender
    
    *   Typically mobile phone number would be listed first, as it is the most common and user-friendly proxy type and the more obscure proxy types at the end of the list)
        
    
*   For the _ACCT_ address types, “clearingSystemId” links to the ISO 20022 _External Clearing System Identification Code_ of the instant payment system which accepts that address type. (Example values are given below.)
    
*   For proxy address types, ”proxyDirectoryId” links to the ID of the proxy scheme that a proxy type belongs to.

The ISO 20022 external code set does not have a code type for proxy directory or proxy scheme. It may be necessary to register a new code type for this purpose.

Example mobile proxy

Note there are two inputs for a mobile proxy:

*   The first is the text input field where the Sender will provide the mobile number of the Recipient. (This input starts with the “{“ prior to the first “attributes:”).
    
*   The second is a hidden field which includes the `MBNO` address type (and proxy type) code. This `addressTypeCode` information will be required by the PSP to prepare the [`acmt.023`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.023-identification-verification-request)
     proxy resolution request.

Account Identification


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that there are three inputs for an Account Identification:

*   The first input is the text input field where the Sender can input the Account Identification (`accountOrProxyId`)
    
*   The second input is the text input where the Sender can input the Financial Institution Identification (`finInstId`)
    
*   The third is a hidden field which includes the code of the address type (“addressTypeCode”), which in this case is `ACCC`.

# Address Types & Inputs | Nexus Payments Docs

Nexus maintains a record of the **address types** (such as IBAN, Account Identifications or proxies) available in each country in the network, and the specific **input fields** that are required for each address type.

This information is initially provided by the IPSO or PDO in that country, at the point at which they are onboarded to Nexus. The information is then provided to PSPs through the Nexus APIs.

The data model for address types and inputs is described below, followed by examples.

**CODE (ISO 20022)**

Meaning

Type

Notes

BICFI

Business Identifier Code for Financial Institution

Financial Institution Id

Used in conjunction with an Account Identifier (and in some countries, with the proxy)

LEI

Legal Entity Identifier

Financial Institution Id

We are not aware of any IPS that uses LEIs to address payments, but the ISO 20022 messages can support use of LEI.

ClrSysMmbId

(Non-BIC) Clearing System Member Id

Financial Institution Id

Used in conjunction with an Account Identifier. Maps to ISO 20022 element _Financial Institution Identification > Clearing System Member Identification > Member Id_

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/address-types-and-inputs#toc163730910)

Address inputs


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Nexus, each **address** _**type**_ includes **one or more address** _**inputs**_**.** For example:

*   An IBAN has only one address input (the `_IBAN_` field), because the IBAN itself combines information about the country, Financial Institution Id and Account Id.
    
*   An `_ACCT_` will require two inputs: the Account Identification itself, plus a Financial Institution Identification such as a BIC (`BICFI`) or non-BIC `Clearing System Member Id`, such as sort code, routing number etc.
    
*   A proxy normally requires only one input – the proxy identifier (such as a mobile phone number)
    

circle-exclamation

In some cases, such as the Philippines, a Financial Institution Identification must also be provided for each proxy (as the same proxy may be registered to multiple financial institutions in the Philippines).

The Nexus APIs provide a list of the address inputs in a format that can be used by a PSP’s client application to dynamically generate the addressing form. Each input is defined in terms that are agnostic to programming frameworks (eg they are similar to common HTML attribute definitions), as shown in the table below.

The Nexus APIs also return some “hidden” inputs such as the account/proxy type code. These are fixed (ie not set by the Sender) and inform the Source PSP’s app how the address type should be processed. In some cases, the hidden information must be included in the `acmt.023` message (such as the proxy type code when a proxy is used).

TABLE: Address Input structure

ELEMENT

SUB ELEMENT

FORMAT

USAGE

Label

Code

Text

Same as the Address Type code or Financial Institution Identification Type code above. E.g. _IBAN, ACCT_ or a proxy type code like _MBNO._

This code can be mapped to the app user’s language.

Title

Key-value pair, where key is the 2-letter language code (eg “en”) and the value is the explanatory title

Further description that can be used to guide the Sender, to be used in a tooltip or explanatory text below the input form.

A description in English (“en”) should always be provided. PDOs may choose to add additional languages based on the likely language of Senders to that country. (For example, countries may wish to add the languages of their closest trading partners and remittance corridors.)

For example, for a proxy type NIDN (National Identify Number) for Singapore, the description may be “NRIC/FIN” – two national identity number types)

Attributes

Name

ENUM: accountIdOrProxyId, addressTypeCode, finInstId

Suggested name of the form element that takes the input from the Sender. (Note: addressTypeCode would be a hidden input that is not visible to the Sender.)

Note: this is NOT the name of the input type that should be shown to the Sender – for that, see Label.Code

Type

Valid HTML input “type” attribute

Describes the type of HTML input element, eg text, tel, number, email

Pattern

Regular expression

Used to validate the form. (For email, this should be null, relying on the browser or app’s default email validation instead.)

Placeholder

Text

An example value that can optionally be shown in the input element before the Sender begins to enter information

Required

true/false

Whether this input is required or optional. (Currently all inputs are set to required. Optional inputs may be used in cases where a comparison model of account resolution is used, in which the Sender can optionally provide information about the Recipient that would be compared by the Destination PSP against their own verified records.)

ISO 20022 Path

(Code of the message type without the dot e.g. “_acmt024”)_

Text

The XPath to the position in an ISO 20022 message where this information can be used. Multiple message types may be specified, depending on whether proxy resolution is required first, or whether the input can be used directly in the pacs.008 payment instruction.

**NB:** The message name is defined without the period/dot character “.”, because the dot character is used in JavaScript to refer to properties of a JSON object (eg “attributes.name”).

*   “displayOrder” describes the order in which the proxy scheme recommends listing the address types when they are shown to the Sender (typically with mobile first, as the most common and user-friendly proxy type and the more obscure proxy types at the end of the list)
    
*   For the _ACCT_ address types “clearingSystemId” links to the internal Nexus ID of the instant payment system which accepts that address type
    
*   For proxy address types, ”proxyDirectoryId” links to the ID of the proxy scheme that a proxy type belongs to.

Below are three example descriptions of the **address types.** Firstly for a mobile phone proxy registered in Singapore, secondly for a Singaporean Account Identification, and third, for an IBAN registered in the UK.

Example mobile proxy

Note there are two inputs for a mobile proxy:

*   The first is the text input field where the Sender will provide the mobile number of the Recipient. (This input starts with the “{“ prior to the first “attributes:”).
    
*   The second is a hidden field which includes the `MBNO` address type (and proxy type) code. This `addressTypeCode` information will be required by the PSP to prepare the `acmt.023` proxy resolution request.

Example account Identification

Note that there are three inputs for an Account Identification:

*   The first input is the text input field where the Sender can input the Account Identification (`accountOrProxyId`)
    
*   The second input is the text input where the Sender can input the Financial Institution Id (`finInstId`)
    
*   The third is a hidden field which includes the code of the address type (“addressTypeCode”), which in this case is `ACCC`.

Example IBAN

For IBAN, only one text input is required, plus the hidden field addressTypeCode set to “IBAN”. The following example is for an IBAN to the United Kingdom.

List of PSPs

Nexus provides an API operation that returns a list of PSPs in a specific country along with their corresponding BICs:

`GET /countries/{countryCode}/psps`

This can be used to generate a drop-down `<select>` menu item that allows the user to select the name of the PSP rather than entering the BIC manually.

This is useful for countries (such as the Philippines) that require the financial institution to be identified when using a proxy, or for countries (such as Singapore) where the convention is for the Recipient to share the full name of their PSP rather than the BIC.

For usability, PSP app developers should enable the type-ahead feature that allows the user to start typing the PSP name to filter the list.

Masking of names

*   The Recipient’s full name **must** be shared in full (unmasked) with the Source PSP to support sanctions screening. This information should be provided in the `_IdVrfctnReq/Rpt/UpdtdPtyAndAcctId/Pty/Nm_` element of the `acmt.024` message.
    
*   The Destination PSP **may** also share a ‘display name’, which could be the full name (unmasked) or the full name partially masked. This should be provided in the `_IdVrfctnReq/Rpt/UpdtdPtyAndAcctId/Acct/Nm_` element of the `acmt.024` message.
    
*   The Destination PSP is responsible for masking the name according to their own privacy and data protection preferences, policies or local regulations. Nexus will not mask or alter the information provided in the `_IdVrfctnReq/Rpt/UpdtdPtyAndAcctId/Acct/Nm_` element of the `acmt.024` message.

# Joining Nexus as a third-party FXP | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

This page relates **only** to third-party FX Providers.

For Source PSPs that provide their own FX, a different process applies. See [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
 for details.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/joining-nexus-as-a-third-party-fxp#toc163809564)

Eligibility to be an FXP


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A third-party FX Provider must be a licensed financial institution that is:

1.  **Willing to quote FX rates for specific currency pairs between Nexus countries** (ie. from currency A in IPS-A to currency B in IPS-B). These rates will be shown to Source PSPs that have a business relationship with the FXP, when one of those PSPs calls the `GET /quotes/` API.
    
2.  **Able to hold funds in at least two instant payment systems (IPSs)**, either directly through their own membership of the IPS, or indirectly through an account they hold with a Settlement Access Provider (SAP). (See [Accessing Instant Payment Systems](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/accessing-instant-payment-systems)
    .)
    
3.  **Licensed to perform the role as FX Provider** by the regulator in their home jurisdiction (if applicable) and compliant with all relevant regulatory requirements in that jurisdiction.
    
4.  **Compliant with any local regulatory requirements** that apply to each currency that the FX Provider offers (including acquiring local licenses where required, eg for currencies with capital flow measures)
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/joining-nexus-as-a-third-party-fxp#toc163809565)

Joining the Nexus Scheme


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An FXP must sign an adherence agreement to become a direct member of the Nexus Scheme. The adherence agreement requires them to comply with the various obligations and responsibilities of being an FXP in Nexus, as defined in the Nexus Scheme rulebook.

The FXP must provide the Nexus Scheme Organisation with evidence that the FXP has the necessary licenses to provide FX for their chosen currency pairs.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/joining-nexus-as-a-third-party-fxp#toc163809566)

Onboarding with Nexus and setting up reference data


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the point of onboarding, an FXP must inform Nexus of:

1.  The **currency pairs** that it wishes to quote for.
    
2.  The **PSPs** with which the FXP has a business relationship (ie is willing to offer FX conversion services to). (See [Onboarding PSPs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/onboarding-psps)
    .)
    
3.  The **IPSs in which it is able to hold funds** (either through membership or via Settlement Access Providers – see next section)
    
4.  For e**ach IPS where the FXP is a member** (ie where the FXP acts as SAP to itself):
    
    1.  the **FXP's Financial Institution Identification** (such as BIC, LEI or Clearing System Member Identification) in that IPS. This is used to identify the FXP's account at the IPS, through which Nexus payments will flow.
        
    2.  the **account identifier/number** of an account at the FXP (used for internal accounting of transactions related to Nexus payments)
        
    
5.  For **each IPS where the FXP uses an SAP**:
    
    1.  the **Financial Institution Identification** (such as BIC, LEI or Clearing System Member Identification) of the FXP's SAP, and
        
    2.  the **account identifier/number of the FXP's account at that Settlement Access Provider** (which will be credited/debited by the SAP as appropriate)
        
    

This information is stored by Nexus and used to route payments to and from the FXP's account in various countries. It is provided to PSPs when they call the `GET /quotes/{quoteId}/intermediaryAgents/` API operation with a valid quote ID.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/joining-nexus-as-a-third-party-fxp#toc163809567)

Integrating with Nexus


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FXPs will need to develop (or adapt) their systems to:

*   Submit information about rates, tier-based improvements, PSP-based improvements and new business relationships to the Nexus APIs
    
*   Accept notifications of completed payments from the Nexus APIs
    
*   Process these notifications and (if necessary) integrate the information into the systems that track their liquidity in different currencies
    
*   Revise their rates as needed in order to manage their liquidity

*   how third-party FXPs submit rates to Nexus
    
*   how Nexus uses these rates to generate quotes and supply those quotes to PSPs
    
*   the obligations on third-party FX Providers
    
*   how the FX rate is validated when Nexus processes a payment
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/key-points#id-60-second-summary)

60-SECOND SUMMARY


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Every cross-border, cross-currency payment requires an actor who is willing and able to exchange one currency for another. In Nexus, the entity providing this service plays the role of **FX Provider (FXP)**.
    
*   In some cases the **Source PSP** will act as FX Provider for its own payments. This can happen when:
    
    *   the Source PSP is a participant in both the Source IPS and the Destination IPS for a specific corridor, or
        
    *   the Source PSP holds the destination currency in an account with another PSP in the Destination Country, and that PSP is willing to act as Settlement Access Provider (described later) to the Source PSP.
        
    
*   When a **Source PSP acts as an FX Provider to itself,** it can determine the FX rate for each payment and specify this FX rate in the payment instruction. It does not need to inform Nexus of the FX rate in advance.
    
*   In other cases, the Source PSP will make use of a **third-party FX Provider**. A third-party FX Provider is any financial institution who provides FX conversion for the payments of another PSP. Source PSPs will need to use third-party FXPs when:
    
    *   the Source PSP is not a participant in the Destination IPS, and
        
    *   the Source PSP does not hold the destination currency in an account in the Destination Country.
        
    
*   **Third-party FXPs** would be **regulated financial institutions** that are willing to accept the Source Currency from the sender and pay out the Destination Currency to the recipient.
    
*   A third-party FX Provider must be a licensed and regulated entity but does not necessarily need to be a bank or non-bank Payment Service Provider.
    
*   Third-party FX Providers must **inform Nexus of the current rates** at which they are willing to exchange one currency for another.
    
    *   Nexus does not ask third party FXPs to bid on individual payments. Instead, Nexus uses the rates provided by FXPs to generate **quotes** which are provided to PSPs at the point that a Sender sets up a payment.
        
    *   An FXP may choose to **improve their rates for larger payments**. For each currency, the FXP will inform Nexus of the tiers and thresholds at which better rates start to apply, and by how much the rate must be improved. Nexus will automatically calculate any improvements for larger payments and apply them to the quote given to the Source PSP.
        
    *   An FXP may choose to **improve rates for specific PSPs**. The FXP will inform Nexus of the PSPs it wishes to deal with, and by how much rate must be improved for that FXP. Nexus will automatically calculate any improvements applicable to each PSP.
        
    
*   Each payments **corridor** between two countries and currencies must have **one or more third-party FX Providers**, who are in competition with each other to provide the best rates.
    
*   **Settlement Access Providers (SAPs)** are existing PSPs who are willing to provide accounts to:
    
    *   third-party FX Providers who are not members of the IPS, and/or
        
    *   Source PSPs in another country.
        
    
*   SAPs are important because they ensure that FX provision in Nexus is not limited to large international banks who are members of two or more instant payment systems. SAPs help to open FX provision in Nexus to a wider range of financial institutions, including non-bank, non-PSP financial institutions who are not eligible to become IPS members.
    
*   There may be multiple FXPs per IPS and per corridor, and multiple SAPs per IPS. The FXP is responsible for selecting the SAP they wish to use.
    
*   **Scheme adherence:** Third-party FX Providers (ie those who provide FX to other PSPs) must be **direct participants in the Nexus scheme**. (Source PSPs who only provide FX conversion for their own payments – but do not act as a third-party FX Provider to other PSPs – may remain as indirect participants in Nexus, as per any other PSP.)
    
*   **Fees & Costs:** Third-party FX Providers need to offer an FX rate that is sufficient to cover all their own costs and required profit margin. FXPs are not permitted to charge a fee or make a deduction from the value of the payment transferred.
    
    *   If the FXP holds accounts at SAPs, it will need to pay fees to those SAP; these fees are negotiated bilaterally between the FXP and the SAP.
        
    
*   **Communication with Nexus:** FXPs communicate with Nexus Gateways directly, sending API requests via HTTPS over the internet.

# Role of the FX Provider | Nexus Payments Docs

Every cross-border, cross-currency payment requires an actor who is willing and able to swap one currency for another. In Nexus, the entity providing this service plays the role of **FX Provider**.

This is one of the three key **roles** that a financial institution may play in Nexus:

*   **Payment Service Provider (PSP)**, sending and receiving payments on behalf of customers
    
*   **FX Provider (FXP)**, providing FX rates and FX conversion to PSPs
    
*   **Settlement Access Provider (SAP),** who provide FXPs (or PSPs) who are not themselves members of an IPS with accounts which can send and receive payments through a specific Instant Payment System (IPS)
    

circle-info

The key roles in Nexus are described in more detail in [Chapter 2.3 of the Nexus (2024) reportarrow-up-right](https://www.nexusglobalpayments.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Project-Nexus-Report-Phase-3.pdf)
.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/role-of-the-fx-provider#when-fx-is-provided-by-the-source-psp)

When FX is provided by the Source PSP

In some cases, the **Source PSP will act as FXP for its own payments**; this may happen when:

When FX is provided by a third-party FX Provider

In other cases, the Source PSP will make use of a **third-party FXP**; this is more common when the Source PSP only operates in one country and does not hold funds in the destination country.

Third-party FXPs would be **regulated financial institutions** that are willing to accept the Source Currency from the Sender and pay out the Destination Currency to the Recipient.

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-9f324adc67197e755c48bba0e083d00507945b8b%252Fimage%2520%2823%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=7511cf66&sv=2)

A third-party FX Provider holds funds in both countries. They accept funds from the Source PSP and pay out funds to the Destination PSP

Third-party FXPs inform Nexus of the current **rates** at which they are willing to exchange one currency for another. They compete to offer the best rates for a specific corridor, helping to ensure a competitive market.

Each payments **corridor** between two Nexus countries and currencies will have **one or more third-party FX Providers**, who are in competition with each other to provide the best rates.

Any FX Provider that meets the [eligibility requirements](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/joining-nexus-as-a-third-party-fxp#toc163809564)
 and adheres to the Nexus Scheme may provide FX conversion to Nexus payments.

Playing multiple roles in Nexus


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A single financial institution may choose to play one or more roles in Nexus (subject to eligibility). The role an institution plays may vary depending on the currency pair and specific payment.

The table below shows the exhaustive combination of roles that an FXP may play. When the Source PSP and the FX Provider are separate entities, the Source PSP is using a **Third-Party FX Provider.**

(Each box shows a distinct financial institution.)

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-2ee4c90d74bb981fb54b6499f2b153b6c201707f%252F0%2520%287%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=1ac9c330&sv=2)

One financial institution can play multiple roles in a specific Nexus payment.

Two special cases have a significant impact on the way that the FXP acts:

*   **SPECIAL CASE 1: Source PSP acts as FXP for its own payments (scenarios 10, 11 and 12 in the diagram below):**
    
    *   A PSP that holds the Destination Currency in an account at a Destination SAP may act as FX Provider for their own payments.
        
    *   In this case **the Source PSP does not need to request a quote from Nexus**. They may instead **define the FX rate they wish to apply to the payment**. The Source PSP must follow a special process when preparing the payment instruction – see [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
        .
        
    
*   **SPECIAL CASE 2: An FXP and (one or both) SAP(s) are the same entity (scenarios 5-12 below):**
    
    *   An FXP that is a member of either the Source or Destination IPS may also act as Settlement Access Provider to themselves. (See [Accessing Instant Payment Systems](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/accessing-instant-payment-systems)
        )
        
    *   In this case, everything in this guide applies as normal, but in addition, **the obligations that apply to an SAP also apply to the FXP**, in their capacity as an SAP. (See [Settlement Access Provision](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/key-points)
        .)

Accessibility for smaller or non-bank FXPs


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus is designed to enable a wide range of actors to play the role of FX Provider. For example, the use of Settlement Access Providers enables institutions who are not members of an IPS to access that IPS and provide FX via Nexus. This ensures that FX provision is not limited to the largest international banks (who are more likely to be members of multiple IPSs). It also makes it more likely that there is FX provision for lesser-used or “exotic” currency pairs.

PSP-based improvements


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FX Providers may also want to offer **improved rates to specific PSPs**. In Nexus this works as follows:

*   An FXP may define the PSPs to which it wishes to offer improved rates
    
*   For each PSP, the FXP may define how much the base rate must be improved, in basis points.
    
*   This improvements applies to **all quotes issued to that PSP by the FXP**, for all currencies.
    

circle-exclamation

It is not possible for an FXP to set different PSP-based improvements for different currencies.

*   When a Source PSP calls the `GET /quotes` API, Nexus will review the table of relationships between FXPs and PSPs, and extract any relevant preferential rates for that PSP.
    
*   Nexus will then apply the relevant improvement to the FXP's base rate.
    
*   An FXP may choose not to set any PSP-based improvements. If no PSP-based improvement is set for a specific PSP, the base rate will apply.
    

circle-exclamation

PSP-based improvements only need to be set once by the FXP, and will continue to apply for that FXP until the FXP updates or deletes the tiers.

# Maximum value of a Nexus payment | Nexus Payments Docs

*   **The Nexus Scheme does not set a minimum or maximum limit** on transaction values.
    
*   Each **IPS operator may choose to set their own maximum payment value for Nexus payments,** at their discretion (or depending on any domestic regulatory requirements).
    

###

Setting a Maximum Payment Value at the IPS Level

*   Each IPS operator **must** inform Nexus of the value limit (if any) applicable in their IPS via the Nexus Service Desk.
    
*   This Nexus-specific maximum value may be lower than the maximum set for domestic payments, at the IPS operator's discretion.
    
*   Nexus will share information about the value caps for each country with the PSPs making payments to that country, via the `GET /countries/` API operation.

     in response to requests from PSPs.
    
*   Since both IPSs in a Nexus payment can apply limits, Nexus will apply the lower of the two limits, at the exchange rate given in a particular quote. (See [Quotes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes)
    .)
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/maximum-value-of-a-nexus-payment#limits-set-by-psps)

Limits set by PSPs

*   A **Source PSP** **may** choose to apply their own (lower) limit on the value of payments which can be sent. They can do this by simply limiting the value that the Sender can enter into the payment instruction, and not sending payments over this value.
    
    *   Source PSP-specific limits are entirely the responsibility of the PSP in question.
        
    *   Source PSP-specific limits are not known to Nexus and will not be enforced by Nexus.
        
    
*   A **Destination PSP** **may** choose to refuse payments that are above a certain value, although this **should** be avoided whenever possible due to the negative impact on user experience.
    
    *   Nexus is not aware of any value limits set by a Destination PSP and is therefore unable prevent payments over that cap being sent to the Destination PSP.
        
    *   In the case that the Destination PSP receives a payment above their own value limit, the Destination PSP must reject the `pacs.008` payment instruction with the appropriate reason code.

# Accessing Instant Payment Systems | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

This page relates **only** to third-party FX Providers.

For Source PSPs that provide their own FX, a different process applies. See [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
 for details.

A third-party FXP must be able to send and receive payments in a specific IPS in order to offer rates on payments to/from that IPS and currency.

There are two options for the FX Provider to access an IPS:

1.  membership of the IPS, or
    
2.  through an account held with an existing IPS member (who plays the role of “Settlement Access Provider” to the FXP).
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/accessing-instant-payment-systems#toc163809569)

Option 1: IPS Membership


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this model, the **FXP is a member of the IPS**. This means that:

1.  the FXP already holds a **settlement account at the central bank** which provides settlement services to the IPS. This account may currently be used for processing domestic instant payments.
    
2.  the funds in this settlement account can also be used for processing Nexus payments (in addition to domestic payments)
    
3.  the FXP is able to directly submit payment instructions to the IPS
    

In this case, the FXP can act as an SAP to themselves.

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-c9170c0b38a73958d3f44baecd8f1da256ec3f49%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=db15b95d&sv=2)

An FX Provider may be a participant in an IPS

circle-exclamation

This option is only available to banks and non-bank PSPs who are eligible for membership of a specific IPS. Eligibility requirements to join an IPS varies between countries, so an entity that is eligible in one Nexus country may not be eligible in all countries.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/accessing-instant-payment-systems#toc163809570)

Option 2: Indirect access via Settlement Access Providers


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FX Providers who are not a member of an IPS may choose to **access the IPS indirectly via a “Settlement Access Provider” (SAP).** In this model an FXP holds an account at an existing IPS member. This means that:

1.  The IPS member (an existing PSP) that provides the account to the FXP plays the role of SAP to the FX Provider.
    
2.  The SAP provides **an account in which the FXP can holds funds**, denominated in the IPS’s currency. (The FXP's account holds bank deposits, not central bank money.)
    
3.  The **SAP makes and receives payments on behalf of the FXP**.
    

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-22c587a59908c578fdb9c41dce01374a7fd6310f%252Fimage%2520%281%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=4dafa374&sv=2)

An FXP that is not a participant in an IPS can make use of Settlement Access Providers

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/accessing-instant-payment-systems#choosing-between-access-models)

Choosing between Access Models


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each FXP, the choice of access model may differ depending on the country:

1.  **An FXP may not be eligible for membership of the IPS.** In some countries, only banks (licensed credit institutions) are eligible to join the IPS, so non-bank PSPs who act as FXPs would need to arrange indirect access via an SAP. Other non-banks, such as non-bank FX dealers, are usually not eligible for access in any IPS.
    
2.  **An FXP may be eligible for IPS membership, but the cost of membership may outweigh the benefits.** Typically IPS membership is geared towards institutions that will process significant volumes of domestic payments, and so there are significant requirements around the security and resilience of an IPS member’s technology and a lengthy onboarding process. However, for Nexus an FXP only really needs the ability to hold funds in that IPS. If they do not intend to process significant volumes of domestic payments on behalf of customers in a specific country, the costs of becoming a member of that country's IPS may be prohibitive. In this case, it would be easier and cheaper for the FXP to use an SAP.
    

An FXP may use different options in different countries. For example, they could have direct membership in one IPS and indirect access in another IPS to facilitate an FX currency pair.

In general, an FX Provider is more likely to use direct access to an IPS for countries where they are already established (for example as a domestic PSP), and indirect access for other countries.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/accessing-instant-payment-systems#toc163809572)

Examples


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the diagram below, the **FXP i**s a major international bank. It is a member of both the Source and Destination IPSs, as it has a significant presence in both those countries. It can accept funds in the Source IPS and pay out funds via the Destination IPS (and vice versa for payments in the opposite direction). It therefore acts as an SAP to itself in both the Source and Destination Countries. The obligations that apply to SAPs (as defined in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook) also apply to this FXP.

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-c9170c0b38a73958d3f44baecd8f1da256ec3f49%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=db15b95d&sv=2)

**FXP-B** is a regional bank. It is a member of the Source IPS, in the country where it is headquartered and so acts as Source SAP to itself. It does not have a significant presence in the Destination Country, so cannot justify the expense of joining the Destination IPS. Instead, it uses an SAP to get access to the Destination IPS. The obligations that apply to SAPs (as defined in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook) also apply to FXP-B.

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-c552fc40efaba44c5c79d5197b1c454be63e0768%252Fimage%2520%282%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=989d1e1e&sv=2)

The FXP below is a non-bank FX dealer, and therefore not eligible for access to any IPS. It uses SAPs for every IPS that it wishes to access. It must comply with the obligations upon FXPs, but not the obligations for SAPs.

Tier-based improvements for larger transactions


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Nexus a specific FXP may offer **better rates for larger transactions**. This works as follows:

*   For each specific Source Currency, the FXP may define a number of **“tiers”** at which better rates apply.
    
*   For each tier, the FXP will define how much the base rate (as provided in the POST /rates/ API) must be **improved**, in basis points.
    
*   For payments smaller than the lowest tier, the **base rate** (provided when the FXP submits a rate to the `POST /rates/` API) applies.
    

circle-info

Note:

*   An FXP may choose whether or not to set any tiers for a specific currency, and how many tiers to set.
    
*   Different FXPs may set different tier thresholds for a specific currency.

WORKED EXAMPLE: Tier Improvements

In this example, the Source Currency is Euros. The maximum payment permitted through the TIPS payment system is EUR 100,000. FXP-A may therefore choose to set the following tiers:

**FXP Id**

**SOURCE CURRENCY**

**TIER THRESHOLD** (Minimum transaction size at which the improvement applies)

**IMPROVEMENT** in basis points (applied to the base rate in the FXP’s quote)

FXP-A

EUR

25,000

50

FXP-A

EUR

50,000

100

FXP-A

EUR

75,000

150

This means that for a payment of 50,000, the rate will be improved by 1%, and so the amount received by the Recipient will be 1% greater than it would have been with the base rate.

If FXP-A quoted the base rate for EUR>SGD at 1.500, then the improvement would be calculated as:

*   Improved rate = Base Rate \* (1 + ((Improvement in basis points) / 10000)
    
*   \= 1.5000 \* (1 + (100 / 10000))
    
*   \= 1.5000 \* (1 + 0.01)
    
*   \= 1.5000 \* (1.01) = 1.5150
    

Note that for transactions below the 50,000 threshold, FXP-A’s base rate, as provided in the initial `POST /rates/` API call, will apply.

circle-exclamation

Tiers only need to be set once by the FXP, and will continue to apply for that FXP until the FXP updates or deletes the tiers.

# Managing Liquidity | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

The page relates **only** to third-party FX Providers.

For Source PSPs that provide their own FX, a different process applies. See [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
 for details.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/managing-liquidity#toc163809602)

Minimum liquidity requirements per IPS


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FX Providers are responsible for managing their liquidity in various IPSs to ensure that payments from their Destination SAP (or from their own Destination IPS account if they are a member) can always be made.

*   Nexus informs FXPs whenever a payment is successfully processed against their quote. (See [Notifying FXPs of completed payments](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-flow-happy-path/notifying-fxps-of-completed-payments)
    .)
    
*   It is the FXP's responsibility to ensure it manages its liquidity so that it is always able to process payments.
    
*   **Nexus assumes that FXPs who have active rates hold sufficient funds to honour payments in either direction.**
    

An FXP may be penalised if payments against their quotes fail because of a lack of liquidity in their account at an SAP (or their IPS settlement account, if they are a member of the IPS). (A Destination SAP is likely to check the balance of the FXP’s account before approving or reject payments that reference the FXP’s quote.)

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/managing-liquidity#toc163809603)

Providing rates and managing liquidity when FX markets are closed


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IPSs allow payments to be made 24 hours per day, seven days per week. In contrast, FX markets, where financial institutions buy and sell currencies from each other, are only open during business hours from Monday-Friday. Because of the global nature of FX markets, it is usually possible to trade major currencies for 24 hours a day from Monday morning in Sydney to Friday afternoon in New York, but not over the weekend. This means that there is no “live” market to define FX rates on Saturday and Sunday.

To enable Nexus payments at weekends, FX Providers should continue to provide FX over the weekend. There are two ways they could do this:

*   An FXP may update their rates when the FX markets close on Friday, and leave those rates fixed throughout the weekend, since the market rates will not change. In this case, they would “price in” the risk that the rates in the wider FX market on Monday morning may jump relative to the rates when the market closed on Friday evening. This means that the rates charged over the weekend are likely to be less competitive than those during the week, to cover this risk.
    
*   Alternatively, the FXP could continue to update its rates through the weekend. Although the market rates would not change, an FXP may wish to do this to manage their liquidity in the different currencies. For example, they may make their rates better or worse, compared to other FX Providers, in order to attract more or less of certain currencies.
    

Each FXP must also ensure they have the liquidity to meet expected payment flows over the weekend. This may require active or automated management of the level of funding in their accounts. The FXP could also actively or automatically alter the rates they offer to alter the flow of payments that the FXP is selected for; this will have an impact on how their holdings of each currency increase or decrease. This is a matter for each FXP to manage individually.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/managing-liquidity#toc163809604)

Providing rates and managing liquidity outside the FXP’s business hours


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even though FX markets are open 24 hours per day Monday-Friday, not all FX Providers will be global firms that can operate 24 hours per day. Nexus expects FXPs to operate 24/7, meaning that the FXP should develop a strategy for managing their rates and liquidity outside of their core business hours.

Exceptions may be made to the 24/7 requirement for FXPs who are smaller institutions without the capacity to operate outside of their business hours. These exceptions may be time limited with the expectation that the FXP will eventually build the necessary capacity to provide FX to Nexus on a 24/7 basis.

# High priority vs normal priority payments | Nexus Payments Docs

A payment can be **high priority** when the use case requires near-instant confirmation of rejection, for example when paying in-store, or **normal priority**, for example when using Nexus for P2P or bill payments.

Whether a payment is high priority or not is flagged using the `pacs.008` Instruction Priority element(`/Document/FIToFICstmrCdtTrf/CdtTrfTxInf/PmtTpInf/InstrPrty/`).

In general the Source PSP should set the Instruction Priority, based on what it knows about the type of payment that is being initiated. For example, payments to a retail business, or initiated by scanning a QR code, are more likely to be time sensitive. If the Sender is asked to select the priority, they should be informed of the implications of their choice.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/time-critical-vs-non-time-critical-payments#toc163731059)

High priority payments


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High priority payments must only be accepted by the Destination IPS if the Destination IPS has made the final clearing and settlement of the transaction subject to a pacs.002 confirmation message from Nexus.

*   The Source PSP should set the `pacs.008` Instruction Priority to **HIGH**
    
*   Within the timeout SLA of the Destination IPS, the Destination PSP must process the payment and return a `pacs.002` with one of the following status codes:
    
    *   `**ACCC**` – accepted and credited to recipient
        
    *   `**RJCT**` – rejected
        
    *   `**BLCK**` - funds blocked and will not be returned (due to suspicious or illicit activity)
        
    
*   The Destination IPS must forward the `pacs.002` to Nexus with the timeout SLA. Nexus will confirm receipt with a confirmation `pacs.002` back to the Destination IPS. This allows the Destination IPS to finalize clearing and confirm to the Destination SAP and Destination PSP.
    
*   In the scenario the Destination IPS does not receive a `pacs.002` from the Destination PSP before the timeout SLA, the Destination IPS must cancel the payment and send a negative `pacs.002` Nexus, rejecting the transaction.
    
*   The `pacs.002` will be forwarded to the Source IPS by Nexus to finalize the clearing in the Source country.
    
*   In the scenario Nexus does not receive a `pacs.002` from the Destination IPS before the timeout SLA, Nexus will send a negative `pacs.002` to the Destination IPS and the Source IPS, rejecting the transaction.
    
*   (Note: The Source SAP may only respond with ACCC or RJCT.)
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/time-critical-vs-non-time-critical-payments#toc163731060)

Normal priority payments


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The Source PSP should set the pacs.008 Instruction Priority to **NORM** (`pacs.008` element `/Document/FIToFICstmrCdtTrf/CdtTrfTxInf/PmtTpInf/InstrPrty/` ) when the payment is not urgent.
    
*   Within the technical timeout SLA of the Destination IPS, the Destination PSP must process the payment and send back a `pacs.002` with one of the following status codes:
    
    *   `**ACCC**` – accepted and credited to recipient
        
    *   `**RJCT**` – rejected
        
    *   `**BLCK**` – funds blocked and will not be returned (due to suspicious or illicit activity)
        
    
*   The Destination IPS must forward the `pacs.002` to Nexus with the timeout SLA. Nexus will confirm receipt with a confirmation `pacs.002` back to the Destination IPS.
    
*   The `pacs.002` will flow from the Destination PSP to Destination IPS, to Nexus, to the Source IPS and finally to the Source PSP.
    
*   In the scenario Nexus does not receive a `pacs.002` from the Destination IPS before the timeout SLA, Nexus will wait until the `pacs.002` is received, or a resend is requested by the Source PSP (through a resend of the original pacs.008, see [Investigations](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/investigation-and-enquiry)
    ).

# Onboarding PSPs | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

This page relates **only** to third-party FX Providers.

For Source PSPs that provide their own FX, a different process applies. See [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
 for details.

For a specific Nexus payment, the FXP is effectively trading with the Source PSP by selling them the Destination Currency. This means the Source PSP is a corporate customer of the FXP. **The FXP therefore has a regulatory obligation to complete due diligence (Know Your Business, KYB) on a PSP** _**before**_ **it provides FX conversion to that PSP.**

Once the FXP has completed due diligence on a PSP, it must **inform Nexus** (via the Nexus administration portal or Nexus APIs) that it is willing to provide FX to that PSP.

circle-exclamation

When generating quotes in response to the `GET /quotes`/ API, Nexus will only provide quotes from the FXPs that have approved the PSP.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/onboarding-psps#toc163809574)

Streamlining the PSP onboarding process

**FXPs must accept the Wolfsberg** [**Correspondent Banking Due Diligence Questionnaire**arrow-up-right](https://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/wolfsbergcb)
 **(CBBDQ)** from PSPs**.**

The Wolfsberg CBDDQ is a standardised questionnaire that can be used for due diligence by FXPs on PSPs (and by SAPs on FXPs). It ensures that a PSP only needs to complete the questionnaire once (and keep it up to date), rather than dealing with a bespoke application form for every FXP. From the FXP's side, the questionnaire ensures that each PSP provides the same information in a consistent structure.

Streamlining the PSP onboarding process in this way is important to ensure the FX market in Nexus is competitive. It is best if each PSP in an IPS is onboarded with each of the FXPs that provide FX in the PSP’s home currency. This means a PSP may wish to apply to be onboarded with multiple FXPs, and each FXP may wish to onboard multiple PSPs.

If every FXP imposes a different KYC/KYB process upon PSPs, the cost to a PSP of onboarding with an FXP would be higher, which could:

*   discourage FXPs from onboarding smaller PSPs as the benefits of doing so (potential additional payment flows) may not outweigh the costs of the due diligence process;
    
*   discourage PSPs from onboarding with multiple FXPs, as the benefit of doing so (more competitive rates) may not outweigh the costs of onboarding with additional FXPs.
    

Mandatory use of the Wolfsberg CBDDQ will help to streamline this process.

circle-info

As Nexus scales, other ways to streamline the PSP-FXP onboarding and due diligence process will be explored, including possible digitalization of the process for a PSP to apply to onboard with an FXP. This may include the possibility of a repository for relevant information (such as the Wolfsberg Questionnaire and relevant evidence such as incorporation certificates) that can be accessed (with the PSP’s permission) by FXPs.

Key Concepts: Rates vs Quotes


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-431dda1a6a94609c86ee5783a82bd347e6d31482%252F1%2520%287%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=9e65bca2&sv=2)

The Nexus FX service takes rates from FX Providers and shares them with PSPs.

In Nexus, a **rate** refers to the exchange rate at which a third-party FXP is currently willing to exchange one currency for another. A rate is not specific to a single transaction or PSP. A rate is valid until an FXP sends an updated rate (or withdraws the rate entirely).

Nexus uses rates uploaded by the FXP (step 1 & 2 in the diagram above) to generate **quotes** which are provided to Source PSPs whenever they call the `GET /quotes/` API operation (steps 3 & 4). Quotes are specific to the PSP making the request.

circle-info

To allow the Sender time to prepare and approve their payment instruction, an FXP must honour quotes for 10 minutes after the quote is first shared with the PSP (even if the FXP has since changed the underlying rate). (See [Automatic expiry of a quote](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes#toc163809597)
.)

When a Source PSP uses a third-party FX Provider, the Source PSP must reference the FX Quote ID in a payment instruction (`pacs.008`) so that Nexus can verify and apply the exchange rate specified before it forwards the payment instruction to the Destination Country. (See [FX Quote ID](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257069)
).

circle-info

A different process applies when the Source PSP acts as FXP to itself – see [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
).

An overview of the process for generating and processing rates and quotes is given below. Further details are given in later sections.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/how-third-party-fx-provision-works-in-nexus#toc163809560)

Step 1: FXPs provide rates to Nexus


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   An FXP must use the `POST /rates/` API operation to inform Nexus of the (base) rate at which they are willing to swap the Source Currency (the Sender’s currency) for the Destination Currency (the Recipient’s currency).
    
    *   **A rate in Nexus describes the going rate** or **base rate** at which an FXP is willing to swap one currency for another.
        
    *   **The rate is not specific to a single transaction.** FXPs are not asked to quote or bid on individual transactions. This means that when an FXP provides a rate to Nexus, they are effectively saying “Until further notice, for any Nexus payment, I’m willing to exchange Currency A for Currency B at exchange rate X”. “Further notice” is given when the FXP sends another revised rate via the `POST /rates/` API.
        
    
*   **An FXP may define whether larger transactions qualify for improved rates**. For each currency, an FXP may (optionally) set one or more tiers with minimum thresholds at which a transaction qualifies for a specific improvement. (See [Improving rates for larger transactions](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers/improving-rates-for-larger-transactions)
    .)
    
*   **An FXP may also instruct Nexus to improve the rates it offers to specific PSPs. (See** [Improving rates for specific PSPs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers/improving-rates-for-specific-psps)
    **.)**
    
*   (Under certain conditions an FXP may also use the `DELETE /rates/` API to withdraw their rates from the market – see [Withdrawing a rate](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers#toc163809589)
    ).
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/how-third-party-fx-provision-works-in-nexus#toc163809561)

Step 2: Nexus provides quotes to PSPs


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a Sender initiates a payment, they must define EITHER the **amount they wish to send**, in the Source Currency, OR the **amount they wish the Recipient to receive**, in the Destination Currency.

1.  The Source PSP will then ask Nexus for quotes for that specific corridor and amount via the `GET /quotes` API
    
2.  Nexus will retrieve (base) rates from all FXPs that have a business relationship with the Source PSP. (See [Onboarding PSPs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/onboarding-psps)
    .)
    
3.  For each FXP's rate, Nexus will retrieve and apply any applicable improvements based on the requesting PSP or the size of the transaction. (See [Improving rates for larger transactions](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers/improving-rates-for-larger-transactions)
     and [Improving rates for specific PSPs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers/improving-rates-for-specific-psps)
    .)
    
4.  For each rate, Nexus will calculate the relevant _Destination PSP (Deducted) Fee,_ which is an amount that the Destination PSP retains from the value of the funds before it credits the Recipient. (See [Fees](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees)
    ) (This is calculated now so that Nexus can inform the Source PSP exactly how much will be credited to the Recipient’s account, after the _Destination PSP (Deducted) Fee_ has been deducted.)
    
5.  Nexus generates a list of payment-specific **quotes** with unique quote IDs - one quote ID for each FXP that has a business relationship with the Source PSP. Each quote describes a **final** **exchange rate** (with any improvements already applied) offered to a specific PSP by a specific FXP for a specific currency pair.
    
6.  A PSP may select any a quote from any of the FXPs in the list. (The list will not include quotes from FXPs with which the PSP does not have a business relationship with.)
    
7.  **The final exchange rate provided to the Source PSP is the exchange rate that the FX Provider charges to the Source PSP. The rate** is the ratio between the amount that the Source PSP pays to the FX Provider (in the Source Currency), and the amount the FX Provider pays to the Destination PSP (in the Destination Currency).
    

circle-info

The Source PSP may charge the Sender more than they transfer to the FX Provider. The difference between the amount debited by the Source PSP from the Sender’s account and the amount transferred from the Source PSP to FXP is known as the _Source PSP Deducted Fee. See_ [Fees](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees)
.

1.  The Source PSP must show the Sender the amount that will be debited from their account, the exact amount that will be credited to the Recipient’s account, the _effective_ exchange rate and any fees that apply to the payment. (See [Transparency Requirements](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#toc163731038)
     for details.)
    
2.  The Sender has an opportunity to accept those payment terms, or cancel the payment.
    

See [Quotes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes)
 for more information.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/how-third-party-fx-provision-works-in-nexus#toc163809562)

Step 3: Payments are processed against a specific quote

*   Assuming that the Sender accepts the final exchange rate offered by their PSP, the Source PSP will initiate a payment instruction by sending a `pacs.008` message to the Source IPS.
    
    *   The message will include the chosen `FX Quote ID` so that Nexus can validate that the exchange rate included in the `pacs.008` is correct. (See [FX Quote ID](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257069)
        .)
        
    
*   As the payment is processed, the FXP will:
    
    *   Receive funds from the Source PSP via the FXP’s account at the Source SAP. (This payment is processed through the Source IPS.)
        
    *   Pay out funds to the Destination PSP from the FXP’s account at the Destination SAP. (This payment is processed through the Destination IPS.)
        
    
*   When the payment is completed, the FXP holds more of the Source Currency in its account at the Source SAP, and less of the Destination Currency in its account at the Destination SAP.
    

From the perspective of the FXP, this process is equivalent to a trade where they buy (receive) the Source Currency and sell (pay out) the Destination Currency. Because the FX Provider is selling one asset (the Destination Currency) for another (the Source Currency), the FXP gets to determine the “price” ie the FX rate at which it is willing to swap those assets.

In a conventional FX trade, the FXP would “deliver” the Destination Currency back to the buyer (in this case, the Source PSP). However, in Nexus, the FXP delivers the Destination Currency directly to the Destination PSP. This enables the Source PSP to make a payment to the Destination PSP, even though the Source PSP never directly holds the Destination Currency.

# Annex: Sponsoring PSPs and Sponsored Entities | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-info

*   **Sponsoring PSP** is a PSP who enables access to an Instant Payment System for other entities, such as indirect participants, sponsored banks and/or EMIs. A Sponsoring PSP is a direct participant in the IPS and participates in Nexus, and has onboarded one or multiple indirect participants (these could be wallet providers or other banks, see Sponsored Entity). For Nexus, the Sponsoring PSP is the PSP performing the role of Debtor Agent or Creditor Agent in Nexus. Any processing beyond this role (as Debtor or Creditor agent in Nexus), for example updating the individual wallet balances of account holders at a Sponsored Entity, is out of scope for Nexus.
    
*   **Sponsored Entity** is the party who is party who has a commercial bank relationship with a Sponsoring PSP. The Sponsored Entity can be an indirect participant of an Instant Payment System, an Electronic Money Issuer (EMI) or equivalent who is not eligible to be a direct participant, or a provider of specific financial services, such as investments or savings accounts. The Sponsored Entity has a contractual relationship with the Sponsoring PSP and initiates and receives payments through the Sponsoring PSP. Whether the Sponsored Entity is seen as a provider of financial services and must be licensed, or otherwise, is determined by the local applicable legislation.
    

PSPs can provide access to the instant payment systems for sponsored entities, such as indirect participants or Electronic Money Issuers (EMIs) when allowed by the IPSO. Within Nexus, a PSP playing this role will be referred to as a **Sponsoring PSP**. With regards to the Nexus Payment flow, the interaction between the Sponsoring PSP and its clients is out of scope.

Clients of the Sponsoring PSP have several options to initiate a Nexus payment, depending on their internal processes, the processes of the Sponsoring PSP and their bilateral agreement. Sponsoring PSP can, for example, offer the sponsored entities access to their corporate channel. This can be their corporate internet banking channel, allowing for manual upload or entering of payments, or a machine-to-machine interface, potentially via sFTP or an API. This is to be bilaterally agreed between the sponsored entity and the Sponsoring PSP and is outside of the scope of Nexus.

The Sponsoring PSP should treat the payment instruction from the Sponsored Entity the same as any other incoming payment request and should perform all validations as it would do for any other payment, including an account validation and balance check, compliance checks and fraud detection. It should also offer the available Nexus services; the cross border proxy resolution and the cross-border account resolution.

**Whether a PSP can perform the role of a Sponsoring Bank is up to the local regular or supervisor, the local scheme rulebook and the Rules, Regulations and Access Criteria of the IPS. In order to perform the role of a Sponsoring PSP, the PSP needs to adhere to the following requirements:**

*   **A Sponsoring PSP must be a member of at least 1 domestic IPS** so that they are able to send and receive payments. Therefore, an entity must be a PSP (as defined in Nexus) in order to become a Sponsoring PSP.
    
*   The Sponsoring PSP must be a direct member of the IPS; indirect members are not allowed to act as Sponsoring PSPs.
    
*   A Sponsoring PSP can provide services to multiple Sponsored Entities, and a Sponsored Entity can contract multiple Sponsoring PSPs (if and when allowed by the appropriate stakeholders)
    
*   The Sponsoring PSP must provide one or more accounts in which the Sponsored Entity can holds funds, denominated in the IPS’s currency.
    

Note that for Nexus, the Sponsored Entity is not recognized as such and thus treated as an end-customer, similar to the Debtor or Creditor. Nexus does not prescribe how the ultimate customer is identified in the payment. However, opposed to legacy FIN MT messages, which do not carry dedicated fields to provide information on the ultimate parties of a payment, ISO 20022 offers a clear structure and designated data elements, allowing remitters to clearly identify ultimate parties, thereby improving the creditor’s reconciliation and interbank anti-financial crime processes.

Nexus therefore recommends the use of the Ultimate Debtor and Ultimate Creditor fields to identify the end-customers in these scenarios, in line with the Payments Market Practice Group recommendations.

Given that ultimate parties are defined as sensitive payment information, their correct identification and provision in the payment messages is particularly important for anti-financial crime controls. Any non-compliance (for instance, concealing of the ultimate beneficiary details) may be subject to regulatory consequences. This is also reflected in the revised Wolfsberg Group Payment Transparency Standards. It is the responsibility of the agent servicing the account of the Debtor and Creditor to determine if the ultimate party elements are correctly used.

# Annex: 4-step vs 5-step Processes in Domestic Clearing and Settlement | Nexus Payments Docs

Domestic IPS follow either a **4-step** or **5-step** clearing and settlement model, described below. **Nexus is compatible with both models.**

In the **4-step settlement model:**

1.  The Debtor Agent submits the payment instruction to the IPS
    
2.  the IPS reserves the funds of the Debtor Agent in its system (either based on prefunding or collateral; the mechanism does not change the flow) to guarantee settlement but does not yet settle the payment.
    
3.  The IPS sends the payment instruction to the Creditor Agent for acceptance or rejection
    
4.  The Creditor Agent will EITHER:
    
    1.  Accept the payment instruction and credit the Creditor Account, OR
        
    2.  Reject the transaction, resulting in a return transaction.
        
    
5.  Upon confirmation from the Creditor Agent, the IPS will either:
    
    1.  settle the transaction (guaranteed by the reservation made earlier), or
        
    2.  cancel the reservation
        
    
6.  The IPS sends a confirmation or rejection message to the Debtor Agent
    

In the **5-step settlement model:**

1.  the Debtor Agent submits the payment instruction to the IPS
    
2.  the IPS reserves the funds of the Debtor Agent in its system (either based on prefunding or collateral; the mechanism does not change the flow) to guarantee settlement but does not yet settle the payment.
    
3.  The IPS sends the transaction to the Creditor Agent for acceptance or rejection and starts a timer
    
4.  The Creditor Agent will EITHER:
    
    1.  Accept the payment instruction OR
        
    2.  Reject the transaction.
        
    
5.  Upon confirmation from the Creditor Agent, the IPS will either:
    
    1.  settle the transaction (guaranteed by the reservation made earlier), or
        
    2.  cancel the reservation
        
    
6.  **In case no confirmation is received in time, the IPS will reject the transaction and cancel the reservation**
    
7.  The IPS confirms the positive (or negative) outcome to both the Debtor Agent and the Creditor Agent.
    
    1.  If positive, the Creditor Agent credits the Creditor's account.

Benefits and consequences of a 5-step settlement model over a 4-step settlement model

A 5-step settlement model has the benefit of the IPS being in control of the timeout and the settlement of a payment. Settlement takes place only after both the Debtor Agent and the Creditor Agent have confirmed the transaction. This results in the IPS having control of the final status of the payment at all times.

The downside of a 5-step settlement model is the need for an additional confirmation message towards the Creditor Agent after settlement is completed at the IPS. In the case of high-volume, low-cost retail payment systems, this additional message may be costly to implement.

# Booking flow for Source PSPs | Nexus Payments Docs

Nexus does not prescribe the internal booking flow for PSPs (ie how and when they should debit the Sender/Debtor Account). However, payments submitted to Nexus cannot be stopped or recalled, meaning that payments in error can only be recovered by manual communication between the Source PSP and Destination PSP. Therefore the Source PSP **should** always ensure the payment can be processed on the account **before** sending the transaction.

This results in the following options for the Source PSP:

**Option 1: Reservation followed by Booking**

*   The Source PSP validates the payment and makes a funds reservation on the Sender’s account.
    
*   The funds reservation must be upheld until the final response is received from the Source IPS.
    
*   When the response indicates successful processing of the payment (an `ACCC` response), the funds reservation results in a debit booking on the Sender’s account.
    

**Option 2: Booking with optional reversal**

*   The Source PSP can also opt for the option of debiting the Sender’s account before sending the instruction to the Source IPS for further processing.
    
    *   If the response is received with an `ACCC` code, no further action is required.
        
    *   In case the response indicates a `RJCT` code, the original debit on the Senders account must be reversed, resulting in a debit and credit booking.

# Special Scenarios | Nexus Payments Docs

There are two specific payment scenarios which require additional attention. In Nexus, the roles of Source PSP, Source SAP, FX Provider and Destination SAP are designed as separate roles, but one entity can perform multiple roles in the same payment. This leads to two special scenarios which require specific processing.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/special-scenarios#scenario-a-the-source-psp-is-also-the-source-sap)

Scenario A: The Source PSP is also the Source SAP


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This scenario could arise because:

*   (a) the Source PSP is acting as SAP to a third-party FXP, and the Source PSP chooses that FXP's quote for this payment This is for example the case when the Source PSP provides access to an FXP in its own currency, but does not have access to the IPS in the destination currency. It therefore uses that FXP's quote and pays funds into the account that it maintains for that FXP.
    
    OR
    
*   (b) the Source PSP is acting as FXP to itself
    

In cases where the Source PSP is also the Source SAP:

*   the first leg of the Nexus transaction will be booked internally by the Source PSP, who will debit the Sender’s account and credit the FXP’s account. (Both accounts are held with the Source PSP.)
    
    *   Similar to a normal Nexus payment, the Source PSP has the option to either (a) initially reserve the funds against the Sender's account and book the payment upon the receipt of a positive confirmation from Nexus or (b) book the payment prior to sending the transaction, and reverse it if the payment fails, as described in [Booking flow for Source PSPs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-flow-happy-path/booking-flow-for-source-psps)
        . The Source PSP must fill in its information in both the Instructing Agent and the Instructed Agent sections of the `pacs.008` payment instruction before sending it to Nexus.
        
    
*   The Source PSP will then send the payment instruction to the Source IPS
    
*   The Source IPS will see that the Instructed Agent (Source PSP) and Instructing Agent (Source SAP) are the same financial institution. It will therefore:
    
    *   skip the domestic processing and:
        
    *   forward the instruction to Nexus
        
    
*   Upon receiving the `pacs.002` confirmation from the Nexus Gateway, the Source IPS must forward the confirmation to the Source PSP.
    
    *   The Source IPS should not send the confirmation to the Source SAP (as it is the same party as the Source SAP) and skip any domestic processing (for a 5-step settlement IPS).

Payment processing when the Source SAP is also the Source SAP

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/special-scenarios#scenario-b-the-destination-psp-is-also-the-destination-sap)

Scenario B: The Destination PSP is also the Destination SAP


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This scenario could arise because:

*   (a) the Destination PSP is acting as SAP to a separate FXP This is for example the case when the S-PSP selects an FXP, who uses a Destination SAP which happens to be the same as the Destination PSP.
    
    or
    
*   (b) the Destination PSP is also the third-party FXP for this payment.
    

In cases where the Destination PSP is also the Destination SAP:

*   When Nexus transforms the `pacs.008` for the Destination IPS, Nexus will set both the Destination SAP and Destination PSP to the same institution (the Destination PSP).
    
*   The Destination IPS will recognize that the Instructing Agent (Destination SAP) and Instructed Agent (Destination PSP) is the same entity and skip the domestic processing.
    
*   The Destination IPS will forward the Nexus Payment directly to the Destination PSP.
    
*   The Destination PSP is able to directly book the payment between the FX Provider’s account and the Recipient’s account. (Both accounts are held with the Destination PSP.) The Destination PSP will send a `pacs.002` confirmation back to the Destination IPS.
    
*   The Destination IPS will correlate the confirmation from the Destination PSP with the original `pacs.008` received by Nexus.
    
*   The Destination IPS should not send the confirmation to the Destination SAP (as it is the same party as the Destination PSP) and skip any domestic processing (for a 5-step settlement IPS).
    
*   The Destination IPS will then forward the `pacs.002` confirmation directly to the Nexus Gateway.

# Costs and Revenue for SAPs | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/costs-and-revenue-for-saps#revenue-earned-by-the-sap)

Revenue earned by the SAP


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In principle, the SAP acts as a service provider to the FXP, by facilitating access to the IPS for that FXP. The commercial relationship between the SAP and the FXP sits outside of the scope of the Nexus Scheme and the specific pricing arrangements are to be arranged bilaterally between the FXP and SAP. However, note that the Nexus Scheme does set the following requirements:

*   **The SAP is permitted to charge the FXP for the service it provides.** For example, this could include a fixed periodic fee for the provisioning of the account, and/or a per-transaction fee for the transactions settled by the SAP on behalf of the FXP. These charges are agreed bilaterally between the SAP and FXP.
    
*   **The SAP may choose to supply the FXP with liquidity in the form of a line of credit**, for a charge.
    

circle-exclamation

**The SAP must not deduct fees from the value of the payment transferred:**

*   When acting as the **Source SAP**, the Source SAP must credit the FXP’s account with the exact amount that it received from the Source PSP
    
*   When acting as the **Destination SAP**, it must debit the FXP’s account by the exact amount specified in the Interbank Settlement Amount in the payment instruction, and transfer that amount in full to the Destination PSP
    

*   Any fees charged by the SAP to the FXP must therefore be charged separately and paid by the FXP to the SAP outside of the Nexus scheme.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/costs-and-revenue-for-saps#toc163730740)

Costs incurred by the SAP


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **The SAP will have to pay the fees as levied by** the domestic IPS for the processing. These fees are set by the IPS and are not defined or standardised in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook.
    
    *   In most (but not all) IPSs, only the institution that initiates the payment pays a fee. This means that typically the Destination SAP will pay a fee to the Destination IPS, but the Source SAP will not pay a fee to the Source IPS.
        
    
*   **The SAP will need to apply sanction screening to payments** it processes on behalf of the FXP (if required to do so by domestic regulations).
    

The SAP will need to include these costs in its fees towards the FXP (although some of these costs, such as IPS membership fees, can potentially be shared across other payment services, such as domestic payments).

# Message transformation by Nexus | Nexus Payments Docs

“Transformation” is different from translation. Whereas translation moves the data unchanged from one message format to another, **transformation in Nexus may actually change the value of some elements of the message**.

Some messages need to be transformed by Nexus after they are received from the Source IPS and before they are sent to the Destination IPS (or vice versa).

Transformation varies depending on the message type but may involve:

*   Moving the agents in an instruction (eg changing the Instructing and Instructed Agents after the first leg of the payment has been processed in the Source IPS)
    
*   Converting a currency and payment value from the Source Currency to the Destination Currency (according to exchange rate given in the message, which will be verified against the Nexus quote ID provided in the message)

# Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX | Nexus Payments Docs

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx#toc149289042)

Cases where the Source PSP can provide their own FX

Some Source PSPs may be able to act as an FX Provider to themselves. This is possible where the Source PSP holds an account with a Destination Settlement Access Provider, so that funds can be paid from that account to the Destination PSP.

Specifically, a PSP can act as FXP for a specific payment if:

*   For this specific payment, the Source PSP holds the Destination Currency in an account at a member of the Destination IPS
    
*   The institution that provides this account is registered as a Settlement Access Provider with Nexus and is able to participate in the payment processing flow (eg receiving and reviewing the `pacs.008` from Nexus and then re-submitting it to the Destination IPS) - see [Settlement Access Provision](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/key-points)
    .
    
*   The Source PSP has informed Nexus that it owns that account at the Destination SAP and has authority to issue payment instructions against that account
    

These conditions apply in three scenarios:

*   The Source PSP holds an account at the Destination SAP, which is a different entity, (**Scenario 10** below) OR
    
*   The Source PSP is also a member of the Destination IPS, and so also acts as Destination SAP to itself. However, the Recipient is a customer of another PSP (so the Destination PSP is a separate entity from the Source PSP) (**Scenario 11** below), OR
    
*   The Source PSP and Destination PSP are actually the same entity (in different countries), and that entity is a member of both local IPS. (**Scenario 12** below).
    

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-2ee4c90d74bb981fb54b6499f2b153b6c201707f%252F0%2520%287%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=1ac9c330&sv=2)

(Note: in the last two scenarios, the Source PSP may be able to bypass Nexus and make the payment directly from their own account in the Destination Country. However, this requires building internal systems that perform much the same function as Nexus, so may not be the preferred option for many financial institutions.)

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx#toc149289043)

Process when the Source PSP acts as FXP

When the Source PSP wishes to act as FXP to itself:

*   The Source PSP does **not** need to request a quote from Nexus, and does not need to include a quote ID in the `pacs.008` payment instruction.
    
*   The Source PSP can define any **exchange rate** they want. (The exchange rate specified will be used to calculate how much will be debited from the Source PSP’s account at the Destination SAP.)
    
*   The Source PSP **MUST** ensure that the Sender still has certainty over what will be credited to the Recipient by following the process below.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx#toc163731081)

Preparing the `pacs.008` payment instruction

*   The Source PSP will prepare a `pacs.008` payment instruction which defines the exchange rate set by the Source PSP. There will be no Nexus `FX Quote Id`, since the Source PSP is not using a third-party FXP.
    
    *   The Source PSP can define any exchange rate in the `pacs.008` payment message. Before the payment is forwarded to the Destination Country, Nexus will apply this exchange rate to the Interbank Settlement Amount (in the Source Currency) to get the Interbank Settlement Amount in the Destination Currency.
        
    

triangle-exclamation

Note that Nexus will have no way of validating that the Source PSP entered the intended exchange rate. If the Source PSP enters the exchange rate that they did not mean to, it will still be applied to the currency conversion calculation.

*   The Source PSP must call the `GET /fees-and-amounts/` API to establish the amount that will be credited to the Creditor Account at this exchange rate. (Normally the `GET /quotes` API would calculate these values automatically, but it is not being called in this case.)
    

triangle-exclamation

The Source PSP **must not** change the exchange rate after calling the `GET /creditor-agent-fee/` API. Doing so will mean that the amount actually credited to the Creditor is different from the amount shown to the Sender before the payment was made.

*   The Source PSP must define the Intermediary Agents in the `pacs.008` as follows:
    
    *   **Interbank Settlement Amount:** set to the sourceSapAmount from the response from the `GET /fees-and-amounts/` API
        
    *   **Intermediary Agent 1** = The Source PSP themselves
        
    *   **Intermediary Agent 1 Account** = The Source PSP's internal account number that they use for recording Nexus payments
        
    *   **Intermediary Agent 2** = The Destination SAP at which the Source PSP holds an account
        
    *   **Intermediary Agent 2 Account** = The Source PSP’s account at the Destination SAP
        
    *   **Charges Type** = “SLEV”
        
    *   **Charges Amount =** the Charges Amount response from the `GET /creditor-agent-fee/` API

60-SECOND SUMMARY


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Settlement Access Providers (SAPs)** provide accounts to:
    
    *   third-party **Foreign Exchange Providers (FXPs)** who are not participants in particular Instant Payment System (IPS)
        
    *   some Source PSPs from other countries (foreign PSPs) who wish to **act as FXP to themselves** (by holding the Destination Currency) but are not members of the Destination IPS
        
    
*   SAPs play an important role by ensuring that a wider range of FXPs can participate in Nexus.
    
*   An SAP only deals with their own domestic currency.
    
*   To be an SAP, a financial institution must be a member of the local IPS. Therefore all SAPs are also PSPs, by definition (but not all PSPs are SAPs). Any PSP can act as a SAP, subject to conditions outlined in this guide. See [Joining Nexus as an SAP](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/joining-nexus-as-an-sap)
    .
    
*   FXPs (or foreign PSPs) enter into bilateral arrangements with SAPs to open accounts. The prices charged by the SAPs to the FXPs is outside the scope of the Nexus scheme.

    .
    
    *   It is the FXP (or foreign PSP) who informs Nexus which SAP accounts they wish to use. However, the Nexus staff team will verify that the FXP does indeed own the account at the SAP, and that the SAP is willing to act as SAP to that FXP.
        
    
*   When Nexus issues a quote on behalf of an FXP, the quote will include information about the accounts at SAPs that the payment will flow through.
    
    *   These are defined as Intermediary Agent Accounts in the `pacs.008` payment instruction.
        
    
*   In each specific payment, there can be a Source SAP and a Destination SAP. Processing payments as the Source SAP is relatively simple, as it is very similar to processing payments as a Destination PSP. However, processing payments as the Destination SAP can be slightly more complex, and the process may vary depending the IPS and SAP in question. See [Processing payments as an SAP](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap)
    
*   FXPs are responsible for making sure they have a sufficient account balance (or line of credit) at their respective SAPs. In turn, SAPs are responsible for ensuring they have sufficient liquidity in their IPS settlement account to honour payments on behalf of their customer FXPs. Given that Nexus payments will be 24/7, this may require the SAP to pay additional attention to liquidity management outside of core business hours and at weekends.

# Role of the Settlement Access Provider (SAP) | Nexus Payments Docs

SAPs provide accounts to third-party Foreign Exchange Providers (FXPs) who are not participants in particular Instant Payment System (IPS). They also provide accounts to some PSPs from other countries who are not members of the SAP's own IPS. This allows:

*   third-party FXPs to provide FX to a wider range of corridors, without needing to become full members of each domestic IPS (which can be prohibitively costly)
    
*   PSPs who want to provide FX conversion for their own payments to do so without needing to become a full member of another country's IPS
    

By providing this service, Settlement Access Providers play a crucial role in enabling efficient and competitive FX provision in the Nexus network.

The Settlement Access Provider only deals in its own “domestic” currency. It does not swap one currency for another and therefore is not an FX Provider (although it does provide services to the FX Provider).

Any PSP (ie participant of a specific IPS) can act as an SAP - providing access to their domestic IPS - if they choose, subject to the conditions and obligations outlined in this Guide (and any requirements set by their domestic IPS).

Where an FXP is a direct member of the IPS, they do not need to use a separate SAP. Instead, they effectively act as SAP to themselves (for that specific IPS) and are acting as an SAP for Nexus. In this case, **the FXP must also comply with the obligations that apply to SAPs**, and should also read this guide. The responsibilities for FXPs are described in the separate [FX Provision guide](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/key-points)
.

Acting as a SAP to a third-party FX Providers

For a specific Nexus payment, the SAP is only engaged at the point when a Source PSP has selected an FX Provider’s quote and submitted a payment instruction to the Source IPS referencing that quote. The Nexus `pacs.008` payment instruction will reference the accounts that the FXP holds with SAPs in the Source and Destination Country.

Acting as a SAP to a PSP from another country

For a specific Nexus payment, the Source PSP will specify the account at the Destination SAP at which they hold the Destination Currency. Nexus will check its own records to confirm that this account is owned by the Source PSP before sending the payment to the Destination IPS.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/role-of-the-settlement-access-provider-sap#toc163730735)

**Relationship between IPS, SAPs and FXPs**

**An SAP must be a member of at least 1 domestic IPS** so that they are able to send and receive payments. Therefore, an entity must be a PSP (as defined in Nexus) in order to become an SAP. (All SAPs are PSPs by definition, but not all PSPs will choose to act as SAPs.)

**Nexus does not select or appoint SAPs**. An SAP must be chosen by an FXP (or foreign PSP):

*   The SAP must provide an account to the FXP (or foreign PSP) in which the FXP can holds funds, denominated in the IPS’s currency. (The FXP's account holds bank deposits, not central bank money.)
    
*   The SAP makes and receives payments on behalf of the FXP.
    
*   **The terms between the SAP and FXP (or foreign PSP) are agreed bilaterally**, outside of the Nexus scheme.
    

In terms of the relationships between IPS, SAPs and FXPs (or foreign PSPs):

*   Within each IPS:
    
    *   there must be at least one SAP, but can also be multiple SAPs
        
    *   one SAP may provide services to one or more FXPs
        
    *   each FXP (or foreign PSP) must select only one SAP per IPS
        
    
*   Each FXP (or foreign PSP) who is already a member of the IPS is by definition a PSP, and can act as SAP to themselves. They do not need to select a separate SAP to access that IPS.
    
*   An FXP can use different SAPs in different IPSs.
    
*   The Source SAP and Destination SAP do not need to be the same entity or part of the same corporate group, and do not need to have any relationship with each other or communicate with each during payment processing.

# Payment Flow | Nexus Payments Docs

This section describes **how a payment is processed through Nexus, at a detailed functional level**, following a successful [Payment Setup](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-setup/key-points)
 process.

circle-info

For a high-level overview of this process, please refer to [pages 31-32 of the Nexus reportarrow-up-right](https://www.nexusglobalpayments.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Project-Nexus-Report-Phase-3.pdf)
.

The detailed flows below are split into the two separate stages in the Source Country and then in the Destination Country. They also show both the [4-step and 5-step processes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/annex-4-step-vs-5-step-processes-in-domestic-clearing-and-settlement)
 that apply to domestic payments.

The detailed flows presented demonstrate the end-to-end flow of a Nexus payment. Note that Nexus is only prescribing and mandating the interaction between Nexus and the IPSOs. The IPSO is free to either adopt the proposed Nexus flows, reuse and adapt its existing flows, or design new ‘domestic Nexus’ flows, as long as it adheres to the Nexus Scheme Rulebook requirements (including, but not limited to, provisions on settlement certainty and timeouts).

# Rates from Third-Party FX Providers | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

This page relates **only** to third-party FX Providers.

For Source PSPs that provide their own FX, a different process applies. See [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
 for details.

FX Providers are responsible for informing Nexus of the rates at which they are willing to swap one currency for another.

*   The FXP sends rates to the `POST /rates/` API
    
*   A rate in Nexus describes the ‘going rate’ or **base rate** at which an FXP is willing to swap one currency for another.
    
*   The base rate is not specific to a single transaction. FXPs are not asked to quote or bid on individual transactions (which would cause significant traffic and demand to their own systems). This means that when an FXP provides a rate to Nexus, they are effectively saying “Until further notice, for any Nexus payment, I’m willing to exchange Currency A for Currency B at exchange rate X”. “Further notice” is given when the FXP sends a revised rate.
    
*   A rate may be improved depending on the size of the transaction (tier-based improvements) and/or the PSP requesting the quote. (See [Improving rates for larger transactions](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers/improving-rates-for-larger-transactions)
     and [Improving rates for specific PSPs](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers/improving-rates-for-specific-psps)
    )
    
*   **The final rate provided in a quote to the Source PSP is the rate that the FX Provider charges to the Source PSP.**
    
    *   **The final rate** is the ratio between the amount the FX Provider pays to the Destination PSP and the amount that the Source PSP pays to the FX Provider.
        
    *   The Source PSP may charge the Sender more than they transfer to the FX Provider. The different between the amount debited by the Source PSP from the Sender’s account and the amount transferred from the Source PSP to FXP is known as the _Source PSP Deducted Fee. (See_ [Fees](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees)
        .)
        
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers#toc163809586)

Updating rates


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A rate provided by an FXP continues to apply until the FXP sends a new rate to the `POST /rates/` API.

circle-info

An FX Provider may update rates as frequently or infrequently as they wish. Updates may be sent on a regular or irregular schedule. For example an FXP may choose to update their rates every minute, every half hour, every day or whenever market conditions require.

When a new rate is submitted:

*   The previous rate is automatically expired
    
*   Any already-issued quotes based on the previous rate are set to expire in 600 seconds (10 minutes) from now, meaning that a payment instruction using one of those quotes must reach Nexus within 600 seconds or it will be rejected. (see [Automatic expiry of a quote](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes#toc163809597)
     and [Validations, Duplicates & Fraud](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/validations-duplicates-and-fraud)
    )
    

Source PSPs who call the `GET /quotes` API are only shown the most recent (unexpired) rate from each FXP.

circle-info

**Technical Notes:**

*   The FXP must push their rates to the Nexus APIs; Nexus will not “pull” rates from the FXP’s own APIs
    
*   To manage load on the Nexus network, Nexus may apply an upper limit to how frequently rates may be updated (implemented as an API “rate limit” or “throttle”). For example, given the lower values of Nexus payments compared to wholesale FX markets, there is little need to update rates multiple times a second (as happens in some wholesale FX markets), as any changes would made a negligible difference to the ultimate cost to the Sender. In addition, very frequent updates, multiplied across multiple corridors and multiple FXPs, could have a detrimental impact on the performance of the Nexus FX Service.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers#toc163809588)

Rate uniqueness

A rate is unique to:

*   A specific FXP, AND
    
*   A pair of Intermediary Agent Accounts in two separate IPSs
    

Note that each rate is:

*   **one-directional:** a rate describes the rate of exchange for payments flowing in one direction only (eg from currency A➔B).
    
*   **independent & non-reciprocal:** for a specific FXP, given currencies A & B, the rate for payments from A➔B is set independently of the rate for payments from B➔A. The rate for B➔A is not simply the reciprocal of the rate for payments from A➔B
    
    *   RateB➔A ≠ 1 / RateA➔B
        
    

chevron-rightWORKED EXAMPLE: Asymmetric rates[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers#worked-example-asymmetric-rates)

In this example, FXP-A wishes to reduce their holdings of SGD and increase their holding of EUR. FXP-A provides two independent rates to Nexus:

*   EUR➔SGD = 1.5000 (EUR 1 = SGD 1.50)
    
*   SGD➔EUR = 0.6500 (SGD 1 = EUR 0.65, equivalent to EUR 1 = SGD 1.54)
    

Note that the SGD➔EUR rate is not simply 1 divided by the EUR➔SGD rate, which would be 0.6667.

The rates above may be attractive rate for anyone sending payments from the Eurozone to Singapore, but less attractive for anyone sending payments from Singapore to the Eurozone. This means the FXP is likely to be selected for payments from the Eurozone to Singapore, but less likely to be selected for payments from Singapore to the Eurozone. Consequently, they are likely to accumulate EUR and run down their holdings of SGD.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/rates-from-third-party-fx-providers#toc163809589)

Withdrawing a rate


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, an FXP may need to ‘withdraw’ a specific rate. One example would be where the FXP needs to do maintenance on their own systems, making it impossible for them to manage liquidity for Nexus payments.

In this case, an FXP may withdraw a rate using the `DELETE /rates/` API. “Deleting” a rate would set this rate to expire so that it is no longer shown to PSPs. (For audit and traceability purposes, the rate is never actually removed from the underlying database.)

Even when an FXP withdraws their rates, Nexus will continue to honour any quotes issued against that rate if the quote was issued within the last 10 minutes. This means that after withdrawing rates for a particular currency pair, it may take up to 10 minutes for payments to stop being processed against the FXP’s accounts at the Source and Destination SAP.

# Key Points | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-info

This section describes:

*   How Nexus makes use of ISO 20022 messages
    
*   How to use the `acmt.023/acmt.024` messages for proxy and account resolution
    
*   How to use the `pacs.008/pacs.002` messages for payment instructions and acknowledgement
    
*   How instant payment system (IPS) operators that do not use ISO 20022 messages domestically should approach translation to and from ISO 20022
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/key-points#id-60-second-summary)

60-SECOND SUMMARY


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Use of ISO 20022:** Nexus exclusively uses ISO 20022 standard messages (and RESTful APIs) to communicate with IPS. The first release of Nexus will use `pacs.008` for payment instructions, `pacs.002` for payment status reports, `acmt.023` for proxy resolution or account resolution requests, and `acmt.024` for proxy resolution and account resolution responses. Further messages are not yet supported but are included in the roadmap.
    
*   **ISO 20022 messages are sent to Nexus via API.** See [ISO 20022 Messages](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/apis/iso-20022-messages)
     for further details.
    
*   **CPMI Harmonisation requirements and Nexus message guidelines:** The Nexus usage guidelines are designed to be consistent with the [CPMI Harmonisation Requirementsarrow-up-right](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d218.htm)
     first and foremost, and then consistent with the Cross-Border Payments and Reporting (CBPR+) usage guidelines. Where the CPMI guidelines differ from the CBPR+ guidelines, Nexus follows the CPMI guidelines.
    
    *   Nexus makes some optional elements mandatory in order to enable processing of Nexus payments across two IPS.
        
    
*   **Compatibility with IP+:** Where the ISO 20022 IP+ message guidelines are followed for domestic instant payments, compatibility with Nexus usage guidelines can be achieved (even before joining Nexus) by ensuring that elements which are mandatory for Nexus payments are optional in the domestic message format (rather than setting a “do not use” rule).
    
*   **Payment tracking:** Every payment instruction sent through Nexus must have a Unique End-to-End Reference (UETR) to allow tracking and investigation of the payment. If Source PSPs are not able to add this UETR, it must be added by the IPS before the message is sent to Nexus.
    
    *   Note: There is no link or shared ID between the proxy resolution or the account verification and the following payment instruction.
        
    
*   **Use of domestic messages, and message translation:** The Nexus Scheme Rulebook does not require IPSs to use ISO 20022 to communicate domestically with their own PSPs. However, IPSs who do not use ISO 20022 for the domestic processing of Nexus payments must translate those domestic messages to be compatible with the Nexus usage guidelines **before** sending messages to Nexus, and back to the format used in the domestic leg **after** receiving messages from Nexus. Nexus does not provide a translation service; this must be handled by the IPS.
    
*   **Use of ISO 20022 external codes:** Where a code is used to denote a status, reason for rejection/failure, or proxy type, Nexus uses codes from the [ISO 20022 External Code Setarrow-up-right](https://www.iso20022.org/catalogue-messages/additional-content-messages/external-code-sets)
    . Proprietary codes are not accepted. If proprietary codes are used domestically, they must be translated to the relevant ISO 20022 external code before the message is sent to Nexus.
    
*   **Message transformation:** “Transformation” is different from translation. Whereas translation moves the data unchanged from one message format to another, transformation in Nexus may change the value or position of some elements of the message.
    
*   Some messages need to be transformed by Nexus as they travel between the Source Country and Destination Country (or vice versa). Transformation varies depending on the message type but may include:
    
    *   Moving the agents in an instruction (eg changing the Instructing and Instructed Agents from the Source PSP and Source SAP to the Destination SAP and Destination PSP respectively)
        
    *   Converting a currency and payment value from the Source Currency to the Destination Currency (according to exchange rate given in the message, which will be verified against the Nexus quote ID provided in the message)

# Ensuring settlement certainty | Nexus Payments Docs

Within the Nexus payment flow, a payment is cleared and settled in both Source IPS and the Destination IPS sequentially and independently.

Nexus allows a payment to flow through IPS with any combination of domestic settlement models, including deferred net settlement or real time gross settlement. The Source IPS and Destination IPS can have different settlement models and different settlement times.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/ensuring-settlement-certainty#toc163731052)

Ensuring settlement certainty

Each IPSO **must** ensure that any transaction committed to the Nexus Gateway will be honoured in all scenarios (including a default of an involved participant).

For each specific Nexus payment:

*   the Source IPS **must** ensure settlement between the Source PSP and Source SAP can be performed before sending a `pacs.008` payment instruction to the Nexus gateway.
    
*   the Destination IPS **must** ensure settlement between the Destination SAP and Destination PSP can be performed before sending a positive `pacs.002` payment status report to the Nexus Gateway. This includes any scenario, including (for example) a default of the Destination SAP or Destination PSP.
    

For Nexus high priority payments:

*   the Destination IPS **must** be able to undo, cancel or reverse settlement in case Nexus send a negative pacs.002 to the Destination IPS.
    

**The mechanism to meet these requirements is up to the IPSO;** Nexus does not prescribe a specific model or mechanism. Settlement certainty can be achieved for example by:

*   settling the transaction domestically before sending the transaction to Nexus (the [4-step settlement model](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/annex-4-step-vs-5-step-processes-in-domestic-clearing-and-settlement)
    ),
    
*   ensuring irrevocability in the system and relying on prefunding by participants, or
    
*   relying on a loss sharing agreement between participants.
    

In the case where a payment fails (whether as a result of a decision by the Source SAP, Nexus, Destination SAP, Destination IPS or the Destination PSP):

*   The Source IPS must ensure that, in the case the transaction is rejected by the Destination IPS (including by the Destination SAP or Destination PSP), the Source IPS is able to process the reject and reverse any transfer between the Source PSP and Source SAP.
    
*   The Source IPS must ensure the reject will be processed, even in the case of a default or lack of funds at the Source SAP. This is particularly relevant in the scenario where the Source IPS uses a 4-step settlement model, and the funds have already been transferred from the Source PSP to the Source SAP.
    

In Nexus transactions, the resulting consequences and obligations from these settlement certainty requirements are documented in the table below.

**Consequences and obligations**

[**4-step settlement**](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/annex-4-step-vs-5-step-processes-in-domestic-clearing-and-settlement)
 **in Source IPS**

[**5-step settlement**](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/annex-4-step-vs-5-step-processes-in-domestic-clearing-and-settlement)
 **in Source IPS**

4-step settlement in Destination IPS

*   Source IPS must ensure rejects can be handled correctly
    
*   Destination IPS must ensure transactions cannot be rejected by D-SAP or D-PSP after the payment confirmation has been given to the Nexus Gateway
    

*   Source IPS must ensure settlement is guaranteed before sending the payment instruction to the Nexus Gateway
    
*   Destination IPS must ensure transactions cannot be rejected by D-SAP or D-PSP after confirmation has been given to the Nexus Gateway
    

5-step settlement in Destination IPS

*   Source IPS must ensure rejects can be handled correctly
    
*   Destination IPS confirms to the Nexus Gateway after successful settlement in its system (after confirmation of the Destination PSP)
    

*   Source IPS must ensure settlement is guaranteed before sending the transaction to the Nexus Gateway
    
*   Destination IPS confirms to the Nexus Gateway after successful settlement in its system (after confirmation of the Destination PSP)

# Notifying FXPs of completed payments | Nexus Payments Docs

When Nexus successfully processes a payment which references an FXP’s quote, Nexus will send a notification to an API endpoint provided by the FX Provider.

The notification will give the following details:

*   Date and time of payment
    
*   **Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference (UETR)** of the underlying payment
    
*   Currency & amounts:
    
    *   Source Currency
        
    *   Amount in Source Currency

These notifications allow the FXP to update their internal records and monitor the balance of each of their accounts.

The FXP is responsible for processing these notifications in order to update their internal systems to keep track of their liquidity.

Nexus assumes that the Source SAP and Destination SAP do not provide real-time notification of transactions to the FXP. In case they do, the FXP should be careful not to double-count the transaction. Notifications from Nexus will be sent immediately so that the FXP can keep track of the payments processed.

# Managing Liquidity as an SAP | Nexus Payments Docs

**FXPs are responsible for managing their own account balances at SAPs,** and ensuring they are always able to process payments. FXPs who have active rates must hold sufficient funds to honour payments against those rates.

**SAPs are responsible for managing their own liquidity in the IPS** to ensure that payments on behalf of their client FXPs can always be made. This is especially important for those SAPs that act in markets which are not balanced (i.e. more incoming than outgoing flows) as the SAP (in its role as D-SAP) may be faced with net liquidity flows from itself to other D-PSPs.

For the Source SAP, specific attention needs to be placed on the **processing of settlement reversals** when the S-IPS has settled the transaction _before_ the transaction is processed in the D-IPS, but the transaction subsequently gets rejected by the D-IPS. In this particular case, the settlement in the S-IPS is reversed and the S-SAP is faced with outgoing liquidity.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/managing-liquidity-as-an-sap#notifications-to-fxps)

Notifications to FXPs

Nexus will support FXPs to manage their liquidity by sending a notification to FXPs immediately after each successful payment is processed (specifically, after Nexus receives a `pacs.002` with `ACCC` status). These notifications allow the FXP to update their internal records (see the FX Provision Guide for more details). (An FXP could opt out of receiving these notifications if it prefers to use other methods of tracking its liquidity.)

**The SAP is not responsible for sending notifications to the FXP but** may do so separately if they wish.

circle-exclamation

In the case where both Nexus and the SAP send a notification to the FXP, it is possible for the FXP to receive multiple notifications referencing the same transaction; for this reason, both Nexus and the SAP should ensure that any notifications reference the UETR of the underlying payment

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/managing-liquidity-as-an-sap#toc163730764)

Managing liquidity when markets are closed

As Nexus payments can be made 24/7, including weekends, SAPs must ensure that their liquidity management considers payment flows that may occur out of normal business hours.

# Role and responsibilities of the Instant Payment System Operator (IPSO) | Nexus Payments Docs

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/role-and-responsibilities-of-the-instant-payment-system-operator-ipso#toc163731040)

Eligibility to be an IPSO in Nexus

Eligibility requirements for Nexus are defined in detail in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook, but at a high level:

*   An IPSO must be able to process individual payments between accounts within the timeframe defined in the Nexus Scheme.
    
*   An IPSO must ensure the settlement certainty requirements as defined in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook are adhered to and do not lead to negative consequences for end-users.
    
*   The IPSO must meet the other obligations and requirements defined in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook.
    

###

Joining the Nexus Scheme as an IPSO

An IPSO must sign an adherence agreement to become a direct member of the Nexus Scheme. The adherence agreement requires them to comply with the various obligations and responsibilities of being an IPSO in Nexus, as defined in the Nexus Scheme rulebook.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/role-and-responsibilities-of-the-instant-payment-system-operator-ipso#toc163731042)

Onboarding with Nexus

An IPSO joining Nexus must meet the obligations in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook, and:

*   Make the necessary changes to their IPS to be compatible with Nexus. This can be the domestic IPS and/or the cross-border implementation, where applicable. This is a design choice for the IPSO.
    
*   Lead an industry engagement to ensure that PSPs make the changes to become compatible with Nexus.
    
*   Set up connectivity to Nexus
    
*   Update the Nexus Service Desk with the necessary reference data.
    
    *   The IPSO **must** ensure that this information is kept up to date.
        
    
*   Register its member PSPs with Nexus (via the Nexus Service Desk). The IPSO should register all of its member PSPs, including those not participating in Nexus. This allows Sending PSPs to validate the validity of a PSP. If that particular PSP is not reachable via Nexus, the Sending PSP may still be able to make the payment using another non-Nexus payment channel. An exception will be made in the case the IPSO is legally not permitted to share the data on its member PSPs. (Note that this data is typically already shared via other sources, such as the BIC directory provided by SWIFT.)
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/role-and-responsibilities-of-the-instant-payment-system-operator-ipso#toc163731043)

Onboarding of PSPs

Nexus maintains a register of all PSPs that are members of Nexus-connected IPSs, whether or not those PSPs are able to send and receive Nexus payments.

PSPs do not directly onboard with Nexus; instead they onboard via the IPSO. Upon onboarding with Nexus, a new PSP **must** provide its IPS with reference data, which the IPS must make available to Nexus, including:

*   the name of the PSP
    
*   the financial institution identifiers used by the PSP eg BIC, LEI and any Clearing System Member Identifiers.
    
*   the Instant Payment System the PSP is a member of (ie in which payment systems can the PSP receive payments). If a PSP is a member of multiple IPSs, each IPS must provide the reference data to Nexus.
    
*   the capabilities of the PSP (in relation to the IPS):
    
    *   Support for `acmt.023` and `acmt.024`
        
    *   Support for `pacs.028` (for future use)
        
    *   Support for `pacs.004` (for future use)
        
    *   Support for `camt.056` (for future use)
        
    
*   the go-live date from which the PSP is able to receive Nexus payments for the relevant IPS
    
*   the address information (email address, phone number) for operational matters, including inquiries, complaints, disputes and requests for recall
    

The IPSO **must** ensure that the reference data is kept up to date.

Nexus will make this information available to other participants through the GET /countries/{countryCode}/psps API operation.

circle-info

Note that PSPs who participate in Nexus are automatically reachable for transactions from all Nexus countries. Nexus does not have a facility to allow PSPs to opt into or out of specific corridors.

A PSP would still be able to reject transactions coming from specific sources (be it a country, IPS or PSP) on individual transaction level. In cases where one Nexus-member country applies a total sanction on payments from another Nexus-member country, the IPS could also reject payments from the sanctioned country.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/role-and-responsibilities-of-the-instant-payment-system-operator-ipso#toc163731044)

Offboarding a PSP

Upon termination (for whatever reason) of one of the PSPs as a member of Nexus or a member of the IPS, the data in the Nexus reference data must be updated by the IPSO as soon as possible.

Nexus will make this information available to other participants through the `GET /countries/{countryCode}/psps` API.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/role-and-responsibilities-of-the-instant-payment-system-operator-ipso#toc163731045)

Timing

The IPSO will need to adhere to the timing as specified in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook.

Each IPS adhering to Nexus Scheme is expected to operate with a defined Maximum Execution Time, which is set and may evolve from time to time, by its own governance mechanism. The IPSO will also need to ensure that its Participants adhere to the timing requirements resulting from the obligations of the IPSO.

The Scheme governance determines and publishes the Maximum Execution Time for Nexus Gateways.

The Scheme will not set a Maximum Execution Time for an end-to-end Nexus Payment. The actual end-to-end execution time is derived by adding the MET’s of the Source IPS, Nexus and the Destination IPS together. This is enforced by Nexus when the payment is sent as a high priority payment.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/role-and-responsibilities-of-the-instant-payment-system-operator-ipso#toc163731046)

Rejects

Nexus will not impose limits on the number of rejects resulting from payments in a specific corridor.

It is the responsibility of the IPSOs to signal anomalies or issues resulting in an unusual high percentage of rejects and take corrective actions. However, Nexus may monitor the level of rejects and raise concerns with IPSOs where a reject rate leads to a worse user experience or signals issues with scheme adherence.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/role-and-responsibilities-of-the-instant-payment-system-operator-ipso#toc163731047)

Availability Requirements

*   The IPSO should have the ability to process Nexus Payment requests, with the required availability (in principle 24/7/365), and with business continuity arrangements.
    
*   The IPSO should maintain availability of at least 99.9% (no more than 43 minutes of downtime per month).
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/role-and-responsibilities-of-the-instant-payment-system-operator-ipso#toc163731048)

Compliance

*   The IPSO **must** have signed the adherence agreement with Nexus prior to processing Nexus Payments.
    
*   The IPSO **must** manage the onboarding of PSPs and SAPs to Nexus.
    
*   The IPSO **must** have an addendum to its local Scheme Rulebook and/or a separate -cross-border agreement, stipulating the Nexus requirements that apply to its participants.
    
*   The IPSO **must** ensure that the onboarded participants have signed the addendum or separate cross-border agreement before the PSP or SAP starts to process Nexus payments.

# SAP onboarding of FXPs (or foreign PSPs) | Nexus Payments Docs

**An FX Provider (or foreign PSP that wish to provide their own FX) has responsibility for informing Nexus of the specific SAP accounts that the FXP wishes to use for each IPS.** (The PSP performing the role of an SAP is not required to declare itself directly to Nexus as an SAP.)

*   As the SAP is sending and receiving payments on behalf of the FXP, the SAP is obliged to undertake due diligence upon the FXP. This includes standard Know Your Business checks as well as any local compliance requirements.
    
*   Once the FXP informs Nexus of the SAP and specific accounts it wishes to use, the Nexus Technical Operator (NTO) will contact the SAP to verify that the FXP owns the provided accounts and that the SAP is willing to act as SAP to the FXP.
    
*   After successful verification of the account, the NTO will record these accounts into the system.
    
*   Quotes issued by Nexus on behalf of the FXP will reference these validated accounts.
    
*   These accounts will be locked within Nexus, and payments referencing other (non-registered) accounts for this FXP will be rejected.
    
*   If an FXP wants to change the details of these accounts, they will have to contact the NTO, who will again validate the new details with the SAP before updating the Nexus software.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/sap-onboarding-of-fxps-or-foreign-psps#toc163730739)

Streamlining the FXP onboarding process


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The number of FXP-SAP relationships in Nexus can be significant, especially as the network scales. The number of relationships depends on the number of IPSs in the network, the number of FXPs, the number of currencies provided by each FXP, and how many of those FXPs use SAPs (rather than being an IPS member). It is therefore important to streamline the FXP-SAP onboarding and due diligence process as Nexus scales.

To support this process, the Nexus scheme rulebook mandates that SAPs use the **Wolfsberg** [**Correspondent Banking Due Diligence Questionnaire**arrow-up-right](https://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/wolfsbergcb)
 **(CBDDQ)** when onboarding FXPs. This will save effort across all Nexus participants, as PSPs, FXPs and SAPs will all use the standard CBDDQ questionnaire.

# MESSAGE: camt.054 Bank to Customer Debit Credit Notification | Nexus Payments Docs

Nexus uses the ISO20022 `camt.054.001.11` message format to provide IPSs with information for reconciliation purposes. The `camt.054` contains all transactions with a final status (`ACCC`, `BLCK` or `RJCT`) for the set period. This report is generated daily on an IPS configured time. It can also be requested, covering a custom time period, using the Nexus API or Nexus Service Desk.

For further detail on each element in the `camt.054`, please refer to the [Message Guidelines (Excel)](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-guidelines-excel)

Entry


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The entry section of the message contains all the individual payment entries processed by the Nexus Gateway that have a final status (`ACCC`, `RJCT`, `BLCK`). Not all information from the `pacs.008` will be replicated in the `camt.054`, but the entry section will contain sufficient information for reconciliation purposes.

The relevant ID fields are copied (including the Message Identification, the Instruction Identification, the UETR and the Clearing System Reference).

The entry will also contain the Debtor and Creditor information, the Debtor Agent and Creditor Agent information and the Nexus FX Quote ID.

# Obligations on the SAP | Nexus Payments Docs

The Nexus Scheme Rulebook provides detailed obligations for Settlement Access Providers. At a high level, these obligations include:

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/obligations-on-the-sap#toc163730743)

**Account management**

*   The SAP must provide the FXP with an account denominated in the domestic currency, and the tooling to manage the balance on the account. This may be the same tooling as supplied by the SAP to other (corporate) clients.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/obligations-on-the-sap#toc163730742)

**Due diligence on FXPs**

*   The SAP needs to onboard the FXP and comply with local laws and regulations, including (but not limited to) due diligence on the FXP. Depending on the local legislation, this process may be different than onboarding other corporate clients.
    
*   The SAP should accept the Wolfsberg Correspondent Banking Due Diligence Questionnaire (CBDDQ) template from FXPs, and not require FXPs to use a non-standard process for collecting due diligence information.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/obligations-on-the-sap#toc163730744)

**Compliance & sanctions screening**

*   SAPs must comply with all applicable regulations in the jurisdiction they are based in. The SAP must ensure that any applicable compliance checks are completed before approving the payment. Depending on local regulations, this typically includes screening against the sanctions lists applicable in the SAP’s jurisdiction. If there are no local requirements for screening for the SAP in the local jurisdiction, this is not required by Nexus.
    
*   If local regulations do not permit the SAP to rely on screening done by the Source or Destination PSP, then the SAP **must** have real-time sanctions screening ability.
    
*   The SAP must ensure that its internal systems can handle and process the Nexus payment messages, which may be more data-rich than the domestic format.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/obligations-on-the-sap#toc163730745)

**Testing**

*   The SAP must undertake a robust testing process with the IPS Operator and FXP to ensure that all systems are working as expected before go-live and before any significant change.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/obligations-on-the-sap#toc163730746)

**Minimum commitment**

*   SAPs must commit to providing services to an FXP and must give a period of notice if they wish to stop providing those services. This is to avoid unexpected disruption to Nexus payments, which could occur if an SAP withdrew its services at short notice.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/obligations-on-the-sap#toc163730747)

**Pricing**

*   The SAP has total discretion over whether it offers services to a specific FXP or not, and on what terms. The terms of service between the SAP and FXP will be agreed bilaterally, outside of the Nexus Scheme.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/obligations-on-the-sap#toc163730748)

**Fees**

*   **The SAP is not allowed to deduct fees from the value of the payment transferred;** it must pass on the funds in full.
    
*   Any fees charged by the SAP to the FXP must therefore be charged separately and paid by the FXP to the SAP outside of the Nexus scheme.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/obligations-on-the-sap#toc163730749)

**Allowing payment reversals**

*   When a Nexus Payment fails to complete correctly in the Destination IPS:
    
    *   the Destination SAP has the obligation to return the funds already debited from an FX Provider to that same FX Provider.
        
    *   the Source SAP has the obligation to allow the Source IPS to return funds that were credited to the Source SAP back to the Source PSP

# Key Points | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-info

This guide describes:

*   how Nexus payments are processed
    
*   how fees are handled by each participant
    
*   the obligations for the different participants when sending and receiving Nexus payments
    
*   what the IPSO must do to process Nexus payments from a Source (sending) as well as a Destination (receiving) perspective

60-SECOND SUMMARY


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus payments are processed through the domestic instant payment systems in the Sender and Recipient’s countries. **All funds movement takes place within the two IPS**.

circle-exclamation

Nexus does not maintain any accounts, hold any funds, track balances or obligations on behalf of PSPs.

Nexus does not connect to or interact with the high-value real-time gross settlement systems of central banks.

**Payment Process:**

*   Within the Nexus payment flow, a payment is cleared and settled in both the Source Country and the Destination Country sequentially.
    
*   Failures at any point will lead to the payment being reversed and funds returned to the Source PSP and Sender.
    

**Compatibility with different IPS settlement models:**

*   Nexus is compatible with different domestic settlement models, including deferred net settlement and real-time gross settlement in central bank money.
    
*   Nexus is compatible with both [4-step as well as 5-step](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/annex-4-step-vs-5-step-processes-in-domestic-clearing-and-settlement)
     instant payment clearing and settlement processes. (In a 5-step payment, an additional confirmation of settlement message is sent to the Creditor Agent.)
    

**Ensuring certainty of settlement:** In all cases Nexus requires that each IPS ensures settlement certainty, so that:

*   (a) Nexus payments will always be honoured, even in the event of the insolvency of any participant while the payment is being processed, and
    
*   (b) Nexus payments can be reversed in the case that any participant rejects the payment instruction (for any reason).
    

Certainty of settlement can be ensured through any effective mechanism, including: immediate transfer of central bank money; pre-funding; funds reservation; or loss-sharing agreements.

**Use of ISO 20022:** Nexus exclusively uses ISO 20022 standard messages (and APIs) to communicate with IPSs. IPSs that do not use ISO 20022 for domestic messages must translate those messages according to the Nexus guidelines before sending messages to Nexus, and after receiving messages from Nexus. Nexus does not provide a translation service; this must be handled by the IPS. See [Messaging & Translation](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/key-points)
 for further detail.

**Message tracking:** Every `pacs.008` payment instruction must have a Unique End-to-End Reference (UETR) to allow tracking and investigation of the payment. If the Source PSP does not add this UETR, it must be added by the IPS before the message is sent to Nexus. See [Message and instruction identification](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/specific-message-elements#toc159257057)

**Exceptions and disputes:** Nexus provides a Service Desk to help tracking of investigations, recall requests and disputes. In the first release of Nexus, these cases must be managed manually. In a future release, Nexus will add support for the relevant ISO 20022 messages to enable these cases to be processed via automatic communication between each PSP’s systems (although human intervention may still be needed to make decisions based on the information provided through these messages).

# Validations, Duplicates & Fraud | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/validations-duplicates-and-fraud#validations-by-participants)

Validations by Participants


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the payment process described in [Payment Flow](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-flow-happy-path)
 there are a number of validations of the payment:

*   The **Source PSP** will validate whether the **Sender** has sufficient balance (or an overdraft) on its account to honour the payment
    
*   The **Source IPS** will validate whether the **Source PSP** has sufficient funding in its settlement account to cover its settlement obligations to the **Source SAP**
    
*   The **Destination SAP** will validate whether the **FXP** has sufficient balance on its account at the **Destination SAP**
    
*   The **Destination IPS** will validate whether the **Destination SAP** has sufficient funding in its IPS settlement account to cover its settlement obligation to the Destination PSP

Validations by Nexus


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Nexus receives the `pacs.008` payment instruction from the Source IPS, it will validate certain details before forwarding it to the Destination IPS.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/validations-duplicates-and-fraud#validation-of-amounts)

Validation of Amounts

*   **Nexus** validates that the amount of the payment does not exceed the value limit of the IPSs at two points:
    
    *   firstly, when [generating quotes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes#toc163809595)
         for PSPs (Nexus applies both the Source IPS and Destination IPS value limits)
        
    *   secondly, when Nexus transforms the Interbank Settlement Amount in a `pacs.008` before it is forwarded to the Destination IPS (Nexus will only validate the Destination IPS cap, as any payment forwarded by the Source IPS must logically be within the Source IPS’s own cap.)
        
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/validations-duplicates-and-fraud#validation-of-exchange-rates-and-intermediary-agent-accounts)

Validation of Exchange Rates & Intermediary Agent Accounts

The specific validations depend on whether a third-party FXP is used, or whether the Source PSP acts as the FXP.

*   Nexus will first check to see if an `FX Quote Id` is present in the `pacs.008` message.
    
    *   If no `FX Quote ID` is present, the **Source PSP** is acting as FXP for this payment
        
    *   If a `FX Quote ID` is present, the **Source PSP is using a third-party FX Provider** (ie the Source PSP and FXP are separate entities)
        
    *   (See [Role of the FX Provider](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/role-of-the-fx-provider)
         for further detail on the difference between these two scenarios.)
        
    
*   **When a Quote Id is provided, the Source PSP is using a third-party FX Provider**. In this case, Nexus will:
    
    *   Extract the `FX Quote Id` from the `pacs.008` payment instruction
        
    *   Look up the corresponding quote and its exchange rate
        
    *   Check that the quote has not expired
        
    *   Validate that the Exchange Rate given in the `pacs.008` is correct according to the quote
        
        *   If the Exchange Rate provided in the `pacs.008` is different to the rate provided in the original quote, Nexus will reject the instruction with the status reason “`AB04`” (Aborted Settlement Fatal Error) from the ISO 20022 ExternalStatusReasonCode set. (There is currently no ISO 20022 status reason code for “Invalid Exchange Rate”.)
            
            *   (Nexus cannot correct the Exchange Rate used in the message as this would alter the amount or flow of the payment.)
                
            
        
    *   Use the `FX Quote Id` to retrieve the corresponding Intermediary Agent Accounts
        
        *   Validate that the Intermediary Agent Accounts given in the `pacs.008` are correct and belong to the FXP that provided the quote
            
        *   If the Intermediary Agent Accounts specified in the `pacs.008` are not recognized or do not belong to the FXP, Nexus will reject the instruction with the status reason `RC11` (Invalid Intermediary Agent) from the ISO 20022 ExternalStatusReasonCode set.
            
        
    
*   **Where no** `**Quote Id**` **is provided, the Source PSP is acting as FXP to themselves.** In this case, Nexus will:
    
    *   Accept the exchange rate given by the Source PSP in the `pacs.008`, without validation
        
    *   Extract the `Intermediary Agent 2` account (representing the Source PSP’s account at the Destination SAP) from the `pacs.008`, and **check that the account is registered in Nexus as belonging to the Source PSP**
        
        *   If the **Intermediary Agent 2** account is not already registered with Nexus as belonging to the Source PSP, Nexus will reject the instruction with the status reason `RC11` (Invalid Intermediary Agent) from the ISO 20022 `ExternalStatusReason1Code` set.
            
        
    
*   Finally, Nexus will:
    
    *   Apply the Exchange Rate given in the `pacs.008` to the Interbank Settlement Amount, to give a new Interbank Settlement Amount denominated in the Destination Currency
        
    *   Submit this transformed payment instruction to the D-IPS
        
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/validations-duplicates-and-fraud#toc163731066)

Checking for duplicated payments


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, Nexus trusts the Source PSP and assumes that any payment instructions received from the Source PSP are legitimate and should be processed. It is therefore the responsibility of the Source PSP and the IPSO to defend against sending fraudulent payments or payments that were sent in error.

Nexus uses the **UETR** (Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference) to check whether a payment is unique. Nexus will check whether a payment with the same UETR has already been processed, and will not process duplicates.

When Nexus detects a duplicate UETR in the `pacs.008`, it will follow the process in [Investigation & Enquiry](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/investigation-and-enquiry)
.

Nexus will categorize a transaction as duplicate when the combination of the UETR and the Message ID have occurred before. When the `pacs.008` UETR is a duplicate, but the Message ID is not, Nexus will reject the message based on technical errors.

triangle-exclamation

Nexus will not check whether similar payments with different UETRs are possible duplicates. For example, if a Source PSP sends two payments, for the exact same amount, between the same sender and recipient accounts, but with different UETRs, Nexus will assume both payments are intentional and will process both.

Fraud checks

circle-info

Nexus does not currently have any central fraud prevention tools or transaction monitoring services. PSPs are responsible for preventing fraud. As Nexus payment volumes increase, additional fraud prevention tools will be considered.

# Quotes | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

The page relates **only** to third-party FX Providers.

For Source PSPs that provide their own FX, a different process applies. See [Payment setup for PSPs who provide their own FX](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-setup-for-psps-who-provide-their-own-fx)
 for details.

Quotes are generated in response to a specific quote request from a specific PSP. Each quote specifies the final exchange rate offered by a specific FXP to the Source PSP after any tier-based or PSP-based improvements have been applied.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes#toc163809594)

Requesting quotes


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First the Source PSP calls the `GET /quotes/` API. The quote request must specify the following information:

*   Source Country
    
*   Source Currency
    
*   Destination Country
    
*   Destination Currency
    
*   Amount Currency (requested by the Sender)
    
    *   this will be either the Source Currency code or Destination Currency code
        
    
*   Amount
    
    *   If the Amount Currency is the Source Currency, this amount represents the amount transferred from the Source PSP to the FXP.
        
    *   If the Amount Currency is the Destination Currency, this amount represents the exact amount that must be credited to the Recipient's account
        
    

circle-exclamation

Both **countries and currencies** must be provided because it is not always the case that there is a one-to-one relationship between a country and currency. In some countries (such as Hong Kong) the IPS operates in two currencies (HKD, CNH). In addition, some currencies are used in multiple countries; EUR is used in 19 countries.

Since the Sender can request to send a specific amount in their own currency, or for the Recipient to receive a specific amount in the Recipient’s currency, the **currency request must specify which currency (Sender or Recipient) the Sender used to define the amount.**

circle-info

**Adjusting for the Source PSP's Deducted Fee**

The quote request returns the `Interbank Settlement Amount` that must be transferred from the Source PSP to the FXP. But if the Source PSP intends to charge a Source PSP Deducted Fee, then the amount debited from the Sender’s account will differ by the amount of this fee. The Source PSP therefore needs to add or subtract this fee before showing the final amount to the Sender, as follows:

*   If the Sender defined **the amount they wish to send in the Source Currency**, the Source PSP must **subtract** their intended Source PSP Deducted Fee from the Amount **before** submitting the quote request. This ensures that the amount credited to the Recipient is accurate after all fees have been deducted.
    
*   If the Sender defined **the Amount they wish the Recipient to receive, in the Destination Currency**, Nexus will calculate the fees and tell the Source PSP how much they need to send to the FXP (in the Source Currency). The Source PSP must then _**add**_ their intended Source PSP Deducted Fee to this amount in order to show the Sender what will be debited from their account.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes#toc163809595)

Generation of quotes


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once Nexus receives a quote request, **Nexus** will:

*   **retrieve the list of FXPs that have a business relationship with the Source PSP, for that currency pair**
    
*   **For each FXP, retrieve the base rate** for the currency pair requested by the PSP, and
    
    *   **retrieve any tier-based improvements**: Nexus will check whether the transaction value is higher than any of the tiers set by FXPs for that currency.
        
    *   **retrieve any PSP-based improvements**: Nexus will check whether the FXP has registered a PSP-based improvement for the requesting PSP.
        
    *   **add and apply any tier**\- **and PSP-based improvements.** For each FXP, any applicable tier-based improvement is added to any applicable PSP-based improvement. Then the total improvement in basis points is applied to the base rate. (The two improvements must be added together before they are applied, so that the improvements do not compound.)
        
    
*   **For each quote, calculate the relevant Destination PSP (Deducted) Fee**, so that the Source PSP knows exactly what will be credited to the Recipient. (See [Fees](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees)
    .)
    
*   **Return the full list of quotes** with rates that have already been improved for both tier-based and PSP-improvements. **The quote response will include a FX Quote Request Id, that refers to the original request by the Source PSP**
    
    *   Every FXP-specific quote includes a **Quote ID** which is unique to the PSP's quote request. The usage of this Quote ID is explained below.
        
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes#toc163809596)

How quotes are used by the Source PSP


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the Source PSP receives the list of quotes it will:

*   Select their preferred quote from the list of quotes provided by Nexus.
    
*   Show the Sender exactly what will be **debited from their account**, exactly what will be **credited to the Recipient’s account**, the **effective exchange rate** and any **fees** that apply.
    

If the Sender approves the payment at that rate:

*   The PSP will call the `GET /quotes/{quoteId}/intermediaryAgents/` API operation to retrieve the relevant Financial Institution Identification of the FXP's SAPs, and the account numbers for the FXP’s accounts at those SAPs. These will be used to fill the `IntermediaryAgent` blocks of the `pacs.008` payment instruction that the Source PSP will send to their local IPS. (See [MESSAGE: pacs.008 FI to FI Customer Credit Transfer](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer)
    .) (This information may already be included in the response to `GET /quotes`.)
    
*   The Source PSP will add the specific `Quote ID` to the `pacs.008` payment instruction (see [FX Quote ID](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257069)
    ), allowing Nexus to convert the payment amount from the Source Currency to the Destination Currency at the correct exchange rate.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes#toc163809597)

Automatic expiry of a quote


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Sender of a payment would be shown the **final exchange rate** before entering the details of the Recipient. To ensure a good user experience, the Sender should be able to complete the payment setup process without being asked to agree to a new, revised exchange rate.

For this reason, **FX Providers are obliged to honour a quote for at least ten minutes (600 seconds) after it is provided to a Source PSP**, even if the FXP has since provided new rates.

This works as follows:

*   Each quote generated by Nexus is linked to the underlying rate provided by an FXP
    
*   Each quote has an expiry time set to 600 seconds from the moment of issuance
    
*   When the FXP submits a new rate, quotes issued against the previous rate will be honored as long as the expiry time is not passed
    
*   When Nexus processes a `pacs.008` payment instruction, it will check whether the quote expiry time is still in the future
    
    *   If the expiry time is in the past, Nexus will reject the payment.
        
    

This process means that a quote from Nexus remains valid unless more than 600 seconds have passed between the quote creation time (when it was sent to the Source PSP) and the point at which the `pacs.008` payment instruction is received by Nexus.

The 10-minute limit is intentionally set to be long enough for most Senders to be able to complete the payment setup process without having to refresh the agreed rate. The 10-minute limit is standard across all FXPs for Nexus.

**Note:** The Nexus Scheme Rulebook could require FX Providers to honour quotes for a longer period of time, but this would result in them offering worse rates to allow for the greater risk of market FX rates changing before the sender completes the payment. Ten minutes is considered to be a reasonable trade-off between user experience for the Sender, and FX risk for the FXP.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/quotes#worked-example-quote-expiry)

WORKED EXAMPLE: Quote expiry

**TIME**

**EVENT**

00m00s

Nexus receives and saves **Rate 1** from **FXP-A**.

01m00s

Nexus receives a quote request on behalf of Sender A. It generates a new **Quote 1A**.

02m00s

Nexus receives a quote request on behalf of Sender B. It generates and replies with **Quote 1B**.

02m01s

Nexus receives and saves a new **Rate 2**, from FXP-A. This overwrites Rate 1.

02m30s

Nexus receives a quote request on behalf of Sender C. It generates and replies with **Quote 2C**

09m30s

Nexus receives a payment instruction from Sender A referencing **Quote 1A**.

Nexus checks the expiry time for Quote 1A. Since Quote 1A only expires at 10:00 (600 seconds after the quote was generated), this quote is still valid and must be honoured.

12m30s

Nexus receives another payment instruction, this time from Sender B referencing **Quote 1B.**

Quote 1B expired at 11:00 (01:00 + 600 seconds), so this quote is no longer valid. The Source PSP must request an up-to-date quote and show this to the Sender.

# Payment Process for the Destination SAP | Nexus Payments Docs

In the **Destination IPS**, a Nexus payment will follow the following steps in relation to the D-SAP:

After the D-IPS receives the Nexus payment instruction from Nexus:

1.  the D-IPS sends the payment instruction to the Destination SAP. There are multiple options for the D-IPS to send this payment instruction to the D-SAP, depending on the D-IPS and D-SAP capabilities and preferences. This is further detailed in the section [How the Destination IPS initiates the payment via the Destination SAP](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap/how-the-destination-ips-initiates-the-payment-via-the-destination-sap)
    .
    
2.  The Destination SAP confirms that the FX Provider has sufficient funds (or a sufficient line of credit) with them, and applies sanctions screening and compliance checks (if required by local regulations).
    
    *   If the Destination SAP is happy to proceed with the payment, it will debit the FXP’s account with the D-SAP by the amount of the payment.
        
    *   If the Destination SAP is not willing or able to process the payment, the D-SAP can reject the transaction.
        
    
3.  The D-SAP either submits the payment instruction message to the Destination IPS (effectively giving the IPS the instruction to make payment to the Destination PSP) or rejects the transaction.
    
4.  When the Nexus payment is confirmed by the D-PSP and settlement is successful, the D-IPS will confirm settlement to the D-SAP.
    

circle-info

If required by local regulations, each SAP must screen the Sender and Receiver against the sanctions lists applicable in the SAP‘s jurisdiction, and perform any other required compliance checks.

# Payment Process for the Source SAP | Nexus Payments Docs

In the Source IPS, a Nexus payment will follow the following steps in relation to the S-SAP:

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-391a5aa7c8e27a590dd591c214d889ad42bb3106%252F1%2520%288%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=1483faf2&sv=2)

1.  After the S-IPS receives the payment instruction from the S-PSP, the S-IPS must ensure settlement and/or update the settlement obligations between the S-PSP and S-SAP, and
    
2.  The S-IPS must send the payment instruction to the S-SAP for acceptance or rejection.
    
3.  The S-SAP must:
    
    *   review the payment instruction
        
    *   apply sanctions screening (if required by local regulations, as this is a cross-border payment)
        
    
4.  If the Source SAP is happy to accept the payment on behalf of the FXP (its customer), the following process will be followed:
    
    *   In the case of a 4-step settlement process:
        
        *   the S-SAP will respond with a status message to confirm that it will accept the payment, and credit the FXP’s account
            
        *   the S-IPS will complete the transfer between the Source PSP and Source SAP, and then forward the payment instruction to Nexus
            
        
    *   In the case of a 5-step settlement process:
        
        *   The S-SAP will send a confirmation of acceptance to the S-IPS, and may (or may not) immediately credit the FXP’s account
            
        *   The S-IPS will send the payment instruction to Nexus
            
        *   Upon receiving a positive confirmation from Nexus, the S-IPS will complete the transfer between S-PSP and S-SAP, then send the S-SAP a confirmation that the payment has successfully reached the Creditor.
            
        *   If the S-SAP did not already credit the FXP’s account, it will do so now. The Source IPS will send the Source SAP a confirmation that the payment has been successful or rejected.
            
        
    

In case that the payment is rejected by either the D-SAP, D-IPS or D-PSP:

*   the Source IPS will undo the reservation in the case of a 5-step settlement process, or, in the case of a 4-step settlement model, return the transaction by reversing the settlement obligations.
    
*   the Source SAP must reverse the credit (if already made) to the FXP’s account.

# Adherence to CPMI Harmonised ISO 20022 Data Requirements | Nexus Payments Docs

Nexus is aligned as much as possible with the latest [CPMI ISO 20022 Harmonisation Requirementsarrow-up-right](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d218.htm)
 for cross border payments, as well as the CBPR+ guidelines. In case of conflicts, the CPMI Harmonised Data Requirements is considered to overrule the CBPR+ usage guidelines.

Where the Nexus message specification does not specify the usage of a particular element, PSPs should follow CPMI guidelines. If the CPMI guidelines do not specify the usage of a particular element, then CBPR+ guidelines for that element should be followed.

The following table explains how Nexus complies with the CPMI Harmonisation Requirements:

**CPMI REQUIREMENT**

**ADHERENCE IN NEXUS**

Requirement 1 – To use the **appropriate message** for a particular business function

Nexus uses the appropriate ISO 20022 messages for payment exchange and proxy resolution. The first release of Nexus supports the `pacs.008`, `pacs.002`, `acmt.023` and `acmt.024` messages. A future release will add support for the `pacs.004` payment return message and the `pacs.028` payment status request and `camt.029`, `camt.056` payment recall request messages.

Note that the first release of Nexus is not fully compliant with Requirement 1, as it will allow payment returns to be sent using `pacs.008`, due to local market practice in the countries that initially adopt Nexus. Use of [`pacs.004`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.004-payment-return-not-yet-supported)
 for payment returns will be encouraged in the medium term.

Requirement 2 - To use **ISO 20022 externalised codes** for payments and payment-related processes

Nexus uses the ISO 20022 External Code set for all status codes, proxy types, purpose codes etc. IPSs may translate domestic codes to/from the ISO 20022 codes, but only ISO 20022 codes are allowed for messages to, from and between the Nexus Gateways.

Requirement 3 – To support/restrict the **character set** used for ISO 20022 payment messages to current market practice

Nexus has defined its character set in line with the CPMI recommendations.

Requirement 4 – To use a **common time convention** across all ISO 20022 messages associated with cross-border payments

Nexus uses Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) in all its messages and APIs. This is essential given that many Nexus payments will start and end in different time zones.

Requirement 5 – To include a **unique end-to-end reference** for all cross-border payments

Nexus uses the Unique End-to-end Transaction Reference (UETR), as defined in the technical standard RFC 4122 (v4) as the unique identification for every cross-border payment.

Requirement 6 – To support **transparency** on amounts, currency conversions and charges of cross-border payments

Nexus is designed to offer full transparency on the amount that will be debited from the Sender’s account, the effective exchange rate applied, the amount to be credited to the Recipient’s account, as well as any additional fees which will be charged to the Sender as a separate line item on their account.

A fee that is deducted by the Destination PSP is calculated in advance and recorded in the payment message, allowing the Sender (Debtor) full transparency on the amount credited to the account of the Recipient (Creditor).

Requirement 7 – To include **unique account identifiers** to the extent possible

Nexus is designed to enable proxy identifiers to be used to uniquely identify the Creditor (recipient) account , as well as unique account identifiers, such as IBAN or domestic account identifiers.

Requirement 8 – To **identify all financial institutions** (Fis) involved in cross-border payments in an internationally recognised and standardised way

A Nexus transaction carries all involved Fis in the message, using the business identifier code (BIC) as defined in the ISO 9362 standard, the legal entity identifier (LEI) as defined in the ISO 17442 standard, or a Clearing System Member Id defined by domestic clearing systems.

Requirement 9 – To **identify all entities** involved in a cross-border payment in a standardised and structured way

Nexus caters for structured address information, as well as the use of BIC and/or LEI for corporate identification, but to mitigate excessive impact at participating PSPs, this is not mandatory in the first release of Nexus.

Requirement 10 – To **identify all persons** involved in a cross-border payment in a standardised and structured way

Nexus caters for structured address information, but to mitigate excessive impact at participating PSPs, this is not mandatory in the first release of Nexus.

Requirement 11 – To provide a common minimum level of **postal address information** structured to the extent possible

Nexus uses the latest version of the ISO 20022 message standard, where the key postal address information can be structured in specific elements. Use of the structure postal address elements is recommended but not mandatory, and it is the responsibility of the PSPs and IPSs to provide the information in the correct elements. The Nexus ISO 20022 messages also support unstructured address information.

Requirement 12 – To provide for the transport of **customer remittance information** across the end-to-end cross-border payment chain by enabling the inclusion of a minimum size of structured or unstructured remittance information with the payment, or to reference such information when sent separately

Nexus caters for both unstructured remittance information up to 140 characters, as well as multiple iterations of structured remittance information.

# MESSAGE: pacs.004 Payment Return (Not yet supported) | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

Support for the [pacs.004 Payment Return](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.004-payment-return-not-yet-supported)
 message will be added in a future release of Nexus, when the volume of returns justifies the cost of adapting IPS and PSP systems to support the message.

The `pacs.004` payment return message has a number of advantages over returning a payment via `pacs.008`:

*   `pacs.004` includes elements to describe the reason for the return
    
*   `pacs.004` separately records the “Original” Interbank Settlement Amount and the “Returned” Interbank Settlement Amount. This better accommodates situations where the amount returned is not the same as the amount originally sent, due to changes in FX rates or retention of fees by the Destination PSP
    
*   `pacs.004` allows for recording the Returned Instructed Amount, ensuring that the Sender is credited with the appropriate amount. This may not be possible when using pacs.008 for a return.
    

The main advantage of initiating a return via a `pacs.004` message is the ability to correlate the return with the original message. This ensures that:

*   no data is lost in the return
    
*   the exact amounts (the amount settled in the S-IPS, the amount settled in the D-IPS and the amount credited to the Creditor) are known in the respective currencies, allowing the return to be processed in such a way that the original transaction is cancelled out
    
*   validation can be applied to ensure that:
    
    *   only one return can be initiated for a payment
        
    *   no return can be initiated for a transaction that has been blocked or rejected
        
    *   a validation on the timing of a return can be added (i.e. only allowing returns within a certain period after the initial payment)

# Reconciliation reports | Nexus Payments Docs

Nexus will provide the IPSO two options for retrieving reconciliation reports.

1.  **Via API**
    

Nexus will provide an API which reports on all transactions send and received by the requesting IPSO. The IPSO can apply filters to the API, for example on payment status (all completed payments, all rejected payments, etc), specify a custom date and time range), and/or specific financial institutions. This will allow the IPSO to reconcile the transactions in its system with the transactions processed by Nexus.

The transactions reported in the API contain the UETR. It is recommended by Nexus that PSPs use the UETR to reconcile the transactions and their status in the API with their own systems.

1.  **Periodic report**
    

Nexus will also periodically provide a machine-readable reconciliation report with all transactions with a final status code `ACCC`, `RJCT,` `BLCK` to allow for reconciliation by the IPSO. The report will contain all new transactions since the last report, ensuring the PSP is able to verify reception of all transactions. The transactions included in the report contain the UETR. It is recommended by Nexus that PSPs use the UETR to reconcile the transactions and their status with their own administration using the UETR.

The report is in the ISO20022 `camt.054.001.11` format.

# Recall Requests | Nexus Payments Docs

It is not possible for the Source PSP to stop the processing of a payment that has been submitted to Nexus. Unless the payment fails for any other reason, the funds will be credited to the Recipient’s account. If the Nexus payment is confirmed by the D-IPS, the payment is deemed final for Nexus (see the Nexus Scheme Rulebook for specifics on finality) and cannot be recalled.

In case the Source PSP needs to request the return of a payment, the following process must be followed:

1.  The Source PSP must log a “Payment Recall Request” in the Nexus Service Desk, and assign the case to the Destination PSP.
    
2.  The Destination PSP must review the case within the SLA defined in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook.
    
3.  If the Destination PSP wishes to reject/refuse the request, it must update the case with the relevant reason for rejection.
    
4.  If the Destination PSP accepts the request, it will:
    
    1.  update the case and then trigger a new Nexus payment back to the Source PSP, with the Sender’s account defined as the creditor. See [Returns](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/returns)
        .
        
    

circle-info

The D-PSP is allowed to deduct a reasonable administrative from the amount to be returned for processing the recall.

In a future release of Nexus, support will be added for the following ISO 20022 messages:

*   the `camt.056 FI to FI Payment Cancellation Request` message, which references the original payment and describes a reason for the return request
    
*   the `camt.029` `Resolution of Investigation` message, which informs the Source PSP whether the Destination PSP intends to reject or accept the request, and the reasons for that decision
    
*   the `pacs.004 Payment Return` message (see [MESSAGE: pacs.004 Payment Return (Not yet supported)](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.004-payment-return-not-yet-supported)
    )
    

These messages will allow payment recalls to be processed automatically without manual use of the Nexus Portal.

# Joining Nexus as an SAP | Nexus Payments Docs

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/joining-nexus-as-an-sap#toc163730736)

Eligibility to be an SAP in Nexus

An SAP in Nexus can be any licensed financial institution that is:

*   eligible to participate in a local IPS (and therefore eligible to be a PSP)
    
*   willing to adhere to the requirements as stated for SAPs in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook.
    

Participation criteria for PSPs in Nexus are defined by the local IPS Operator. The SAP must therefore first onboard with the IPS Operator as a PSP and sign the addendum to the local Scheme Rulebook, stipulating the Nexus requirements.

circle-exclamation

An SAP must have **direct membership of the IPS**; indirect, sponsored or technical access is not currently permitted. It is allowed to use a technical partner for connectivity.

circle-exclamation

An SAP must be able to support real-time sanctions screening (if local regulations require the SAP to do sanctions screening).

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/joining-nexus-as-an-sap#toc117254897)

Joining the Nexus Scheme as an SAP

**Settlement Access Providers (SAPs) adhere to the Nexus scheme via the addendum in the IPS’s domestic scheme rulebook.** An entity must be an IPS Member (and therefore a PSP) before it can start acting as a SAP in Nexus. Therefore a SAP must first sign the addendum to the IPS’s domestic scheme, relating to its responsibilities as a PSP sending and receiving payments on behalf of its customers. This adherence process must be managed by the IPSO.

# General Usage of ISO 20022 | Nexus Payments Docs

This guide defines the message standards that consists of message elements:

*   required in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook as business requirements
    
*   needed for processing by Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and Instant Payment Systems (IPS)
    

These message elements define the Nexus service and are denoted in the specific ISO 20022 Nexus message guidelines. This section describes the relevant Nexus requirements, such as the use of the message element, its components or the values that must be used. Usage rules, for example, may indicate limits on the number of repetitions, or code value restrictions, while format rules may be used to indicate the allowable combinations of components of a message element.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/general-usage-of-iso-20022#toc159257042)

Only ISO 20022 messages are accepted


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus expects and will only accept the Nexus-standard ISO 20022 messages (and JSON APIs as defined by Nexus). These messages are based on the [CPMI ISO 20022 harmonisation requirementsarrow-up-right](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d218.htm)
 and CBPR+ usage guidelines. The Nexus Usage Guidelines adds additional requirements necessary for processing Nexus payments.

circle-info

Where an IPS community either (a) does not support ISO 20022 messages, or (b) uses elements differently than defined in the Nexus usage guidelines, then the IPSO is responsible for translating messages to be consistent with the Nexus usage guidelines. See [Translation To/From Domestic Message Formats](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translation-to-from-domestic-message-formats)
for further detail.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/general-usage-of-iso-20022#toc159257043)

Accepted Message Set


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the exception of some JSON API calls, most communication through Nexus is done using messages following the ISO 20022 standard. The following ISO 20022 messages are implemented in the first release of Nexus:

*   [`**pacs.008.001.13**`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer)
     **FI to FI Customer Credit Transfer**
    
    *   This is the basic payment instruction
        
    
*   [`**pacs.002.001.15**`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.002-payment-status-report)
     **FI to FI Payment Status Report**
    
    *   This is the payment status report returned in response to a `pacs.008`
        
    
*   [`**acmt.023.001.04**`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.023-identification-verification-request)
     **Identification Verification Request**
    
    *   Used for proxy resolution and account resolution requests – see [Addressing & Proxy Resolution](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/key-points)
        .
        
    
*   [`**acmt.024.001.04**`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.024-identification-verification-report)
     **Identification Verification Response**
    
    *   Used for responses to proxy resolution and account resolution requests.
        
    

The following messages are **not** implemented in the first release of Nexus, but are on the roadmap for future releases:

*   `**pacs.028**` **FI to FI Payment Status Request**
    
    *   Request for an update on the status of a previously sent `pacs.008` payment instruction
        
    
*   `**camt.056**` **FI to FI Payment Cancellation Request**
    
    *   In Nexus, this would be used to request the return of a previously completed payment. (It is not possible to request the cancellation of a payment that is currently being processed.)
        
    
*   `**camt.029**` **Resolution of Investigation**
    
    *   This is the positive or negative response sent in reply to a `camt.056` Payment Cancellation Request
        
    
*   [`**pacs.004**`](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.004-payment-return-not-yet-supported)
     **Payment Return**
    
    *   This is a payment instruction used to return an earlier payment. It is very similar to the `pacs.008` message structure. A `pacs.004` message references the original `pacs.008` so that the PSP receiving the returned payment can reconcile it against the original payment.
        
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/general-usage-of-iso-20022#toc159257044)

Version


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus uses the 2025 version of the ISO 20022 XML message standards. This is version 13 for the `pacs.008` and version 15 for the `pacs.002`.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/general-usage-of-iso-20022#toc159257045)

Backwards compatibility

Nexus will not support backward compatibility. Any translation between previous versions and the current version will be the responsibility of the IPSO. Nexus will define specific cut-over moments when new versions are introduced.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/general-usage-of-iso-20022#toc159257050)

Character Set


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The efficient processing of cross-border payments depends on the use of a common character set so that all participants in the processing chain will be able to understand and interpret the information. Otherwise, payments risk being delayed or even returned.

Following CPMI harmonization requirements, Nexus prescribes the use of a restricted character set in its cross-border payment messages to the currently agreed Latin character set: lower case characters a–z, upper case characters A–Z, numeric characters 0–9, complemented with the following additional characters for a limited selection of data elements:

/ - ? : ( ) . , ’ + ! # & % \* = ^ \_ \` { | } ~ " ; @ \[ \\ \] $ > <

References, identifications and identifiers must respect the following:

*   Content is restricted to the Latin character set as defined above
    
*   Content must not start or end with a forward slash ‘/’
    
*   Content must not contain a double forward slash ‘//’
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/general-usage-of-iso-20022#toc159257051)

Message Validation


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Messages sent to Nexus will be validated against the requirements in the Nexus message usage guidelines. Messages will fail validation in the following cases:

*   The message does not conform to the Nexus XSD validation. In this case, Nexus will reject the message with error code FF01.
    
*   An element that is defined as “Mandatory” in the Nexus usage guidelines is empty or null, or the entire element is missing from the message structure. In this case, Nexus will reject the message with error code `CH21`.
    
*   An element that requires a code from the ISO 20022 External Code set in the <Cd> element instead uses the <Prtry> (Proprietary) element. In this case, Nexus will reject the message with error code `CH21`.
    
*   An element that requires a code from the ISO 20022 External Code set uses a code that is not in the External Code Set. In this case, Nexus will reject the message with the applicable error code.

# Rejects | Nexus Payments Docs

If a participant (IPS, SAP or PSP) is not able to accept the payment for any of the reasons given below, it must respond to the payment instruction with a rejection:

*   If the rejection takes place during in the Source leg of the transaction, the transaction will be rejected before the message reaches the Nexus Gateway. This rejection can be handled by the Source IPS; the Source IPS does not need to inform Nexus of this rejected transaction.
    
*   If the rejection takes place after Nexus has received the transaction, the Destination IPS **must** report this rejected transaction to the Nexus Gateway using a `pacs.002` message with the status code `RJCT` and an appropriate reason code. See [MESSAGE pacs.002 Payment Status Report](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.002-payment-status-report)
     for more details, including the ISO 20022 error codes supported by Nexus.
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/rejects#causes-of-rejection)

Causes of Rejection

A number of events can cause the payment to be unsuccessful (including due to technical timeouts). For example:

*   The Source SAP, Destination SAP or Destination PSP applies sanctions screening (if required by local legislation) and decides it does not want to process the payment, due to concerns about either the Sender or the Recipient
    
*   The Source PSP has insufficient funds in their IPS settlement account to make the payment
    
*   The Destination SAP checks the balance of the FXP’s account and finds it is insufficient to cover this payment
    
*   The Destination SAP’s own settlement account at the IPS has insufficient funds to make the payment to the Destination PSP
    
*   The Destination PSP finds that the Recipient’s account is closed, dormant or frozen
    

A full list of reject reasons is included in [MESSAGE pacs.002 Payment Status Report](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.002-payment-status-report)
. The [Message Guidelines (Excel)](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-guidelines-excel)
 further stipulates which error codes can be used by which party.

# Specific Message Elements | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/specific-message-elements#toc159257054)

Financial institution identification


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any financial institution in Nexus, including PSPs, SAPs (and FXPs), can be identified using either BIC, LEI, or an alternative domestic format (“Clearing System Member Id” in the ISO 20022 standard).

*   In case the **BIC** is used to identify financial institutions (Agents in the ISO 20022 standards), this may be either BIC-11 or BIC-8.
    
*   The **Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)** is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
    
    *   The Source PSP should provide its own LEI in the <LEI> element. (This can help to streamline sanctions screening.)
        
    *   Where LEIs for other agents are available, they can also be used (but are not mandatory).
        
    
*   **Clearing System Member Ids** need to follow the domestic formatting rules.
    
*   The format of domestic Clearing System Member IDs should be defined by the IPSO (when onboarding with Nexus, using the Nexus Service Desk), as a regular expression, so that it can be shared with Source PSPs when initiating payments to the Destination Country. See [Financial Institution Identification](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/addressing-and-proxy-resolution/address-types-and-inputs/financial-institution-identification)
    .
    

circle-info

**Retrieving reachable PSPs:** Nexus provides the IPSO with the `GET PSPs` API, allowing for the retrieval of all reachable and non-reachable parties in a specific country. This API will also return additional information on the reachable parties, such as the supported services (for example the support for time critical and non-time critical Nexus payments).

Message and instruction identification


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus prescribes two specific reference elements for track & trace purposes across the Nexus network:

#### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/specific-message-elements#message-id)

**Message ID**

The message ID in the ISO 20022 XML messages serves as a point-to-point reference and will be assigned by the sending party in each message leg. The message ID should be generated according to the Nexus Usage Guidelines. This message ID must be unique per sending party for at least 2 months and is assigned in the _Group Header > Message Identification_ element.

#### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/specific-message-elements#unique-end-to-end-transaction-reference-uetr)

**Unique End-to-end Transaction Reference (UETR)**

The UETR is the unique end-to-end transaction reference element, generated according to the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) algorithm defined in IETF standard RFC 4122, using version 4 of the generation algorithm. The algorithm ensures that no two payments will have the same ID, without the generating party needing to check against a central database to see if an ID is already in use.

*   It is highly recommended that the UETR **should** be generated and assigned by the Source PSP, so that there is full end-to-end traceability of this payment using the UETR.
    
*   However, **if** the domestic format does not cater for UETR, the **Source IPS** **must** generate a UETR upon translating a domestic-format payment instruction into the Nexus pacs.008. The IPS **must** be able to correlate the generated UETR back to the payment instruction received from the Source PSP.
    
*   The UETR must be carried unaltered throughout the payment life cycle. The UETR must be included in each transaction according to the Nexus Usage Guidelines.
    
*   The same UETR **must** be included in any pacs.002 reject or confirmation messages sent in response to the pacs.008, and any subsequent return messages that need to reference the original pacs.008.
    

#### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/specific-message-elements#other-reference-elements)

Other Reference Elements

Other reference elements **must be** transported **unaltered** in accordance with the Nexus Usage Guidelines:

*   **Instruction ID** (in _Credit Transfer Transaction Information_)
    
    *   The instruction identification is a point-to-point reference that can be used between the instructing party and the instructed party to refer to the individual instruction. It can be included in several messages related to the instruction. In accordance with the CPMI ISO 20022 harmonisation requirements, this is not required in Nexus (despite being mandatory in CBPR+).
        
    
*   **End-to-End ID** (in _Credit Transfer Transaction Information_)
    
    *   Unique identification, as assigned by the initiating party, to unambiguously identify the transaction. If provided, this identification **must** be passed on, unchanged, throughout the entire end-to-end chain.
        
    
*   **Transaction ID** (in _Credit Transfer Transaction Information)_
    
    *   Unique identification, as assigned by the first instructing agent, to unambiguously identify the transaction. If provided, this identification **must** be passed on, unchanged, throughout the entire interbank chain.
        
    
*   **Clearing System Reference** (in _Credit Transfer Transaction Information_)
    
    *   Unique reference, as assigned by a clearing system, to unambiguously identify the instruction. If provided, this identification **must** be passed on, unchanged, throughout the entire interbank chain.

# Fees | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#toc163731037)

Fees (Deducted)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Nexus scheme specifies a number of requirements around the fee model for Nexus participants. This includes the type of fees that can be charged by Nexus participants and whether these fees can be collected as a deduction from the value of the payment, or must be separately invoiced to the participant in question.

**Only the Source PSP and Destination PSP are permitted to make a deduction from the value of the payment (a "Deducted Fee").** All other participants must invoice each other for the relevant fees that they charge (an "Invoiced Fee").

The following features need to be considered when the Source PSP prepares the `pacs.008` payment instruction:

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#source-psp-fees)

**Source PSP Fees**


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The Source PSP may optionally charge an **“Invoiced Fee”** to the Sender, which should be separately debited from the Sender’s account and appear as a separate line item on the Sender’s account statement. This fee must be made visible to the Sender before they confirm that they wish the payment to go ahead.
    
    *   The level of the Source PSP Invoiced Fee is not defined by the Nexus Scheme and is at the sole discretion of the Source PSP. There is no cap.
        
    
*   The Source PSP may also charge a **“Deducted Fee”** to the Sender
    
    *   The Source PSP deducts this fee by debiting more from the Sender’s account than it transfers to the Source SAP. This fee is thus included in the amount debited and not explicitly visible to the Sender.
        
    
*   The level of the Source PSP Deducted Fee is not defined by the Nexus Scheme and is at the sole discretion of the Source PSP.
    
*   The Source PSP Deducted Fee must be recorded in the `pacs.008` payment instruction, in the [Charges Information](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257062)
     block.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#destination-psp-deducted-fee-creditor-agent-fee)

**Destination PSP Deducted Fee \[Creditor Agent Fee\]**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The Destination PSP must not charge an **“Invoiced Fee”** to Recipient or any other participant.
    
    *   Doing so would break the principle that the Sender must know exactly what the Recipient will receive after all fees.
        
    
*   The Destination PSP **must** charge a “Deducted Fee” by crediting less to the Recipient’s account than the Destination PSP received from the Destination SAP.
    
    *   The Destination PSP Deducted Fee is only applicable to 'person-to-person' payments . 'Person-to-merchant' payments, or other use cases, may have a different fee structure. This is not defined at this stage.
        
    *   The formula for calculating the Destination PSP Deducted Fee is set in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook and will be defined on Country level.
        
    *   The fee will be calculated by Nexus and provided to the Source PSP in the response to the `GET /quotes` or `GET /fees-and-amounts` API operation
        
    *   The Source PSP will include the value of the Destination PSP fee (as calculated by Nexus) in the `pacs.008` payment instruction - see [Charges Information](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257062)
        .
        
    *   The Destination PSP **must** charge the exact amount as specified in the `pacs.008` payment message (as recorded in the Charges > Amount element for the Creditor Agent – See [Charges Information](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257062)
        for details).
        
        *   The Destination PSP **must not** recalculate the Destination PSP. _(Doing so could lead to a rare edge case in which the amount credited to the Recipient will differ from the amount that was shown to the Sender; this edge case can occur if the scheme-wide Destination PSP Deducted Fee formula is revised at midnight a specific date, and a payment is initiated by the Source PSP just before midnight but processed by the Destination PSP using the new formula after midnight.)_
            
        
    *   The Destination PSP may or may not disclose the Destination PSP Deducted Fee to the Recipient.
        
    

circle-info

This fee is described in some places as a Creditor Agent Fee, as it is charged by the Creditor Agent (Destination PSP).

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#calculating-and-recording-the-deducted-fees-in-the-payment-instruction)

**Calculating and recording the deducted fees in the payment instruction**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The Source PSP must include the Source PSP Deducted Fee and Destination PSP Deducted Fee in the payment message. To do this, the Source PSP must follow these steps:
    

1.  For every transaction, the Source PSP must call **EITHER**:
    
    1.  `GET /quotes/` - to be used by PSPs which use an FXP. This will return the list of quotes and the creditor agent fee (D-PSP fee) for every quote, **OR**
        
    2.  GET /fees-and-amounts/ - for Source PSPs which provide their own FXP. This API will calculate the Destination PSP Deducted Fee given a specific amount and exchange rate.
        
    
2.  The S-PSP must insert the Source PSP Deducted Fee and Destination PSP Deducted Fee (as calculated in Step 1) into the _Charges > Amount_ element of the `pacs.008`. See [Charges Information](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257062)
    for details.
    

circle-info

**Note:** The Source PSP **must not** hardcode the D-PSP fee formula in their systems. This is because the fee formula will change, at a minimum on the 1st of every month, to accommodate changes in exchange rates between the Nexus Scheme Reference Currency and the Source PSP or Destination PSP’s local currency.

1.  The D-PSP must deduct the amount defined in the _Charges > Amount_ element of the pacs.008
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#toc163731038)

Transparency Requirements


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees#source-psp-transparency)

**Source PSP Transparency**

Before the Sender approves a payment, the Source PSP must display to the Sender:

*   The exact amount of the Source PSP Invoiced Fee (if charged), in the Sender’s currency
    
*   The exact amount that will be debited from the Sender’s account, in the Sender’s currency
    
*   The exact amount that will be credited to the Recipient’s account, in the Recipient’s currency
    

The Source PSP must also show the Sender one of the following options:

*   **Option (A) Effective Exchange Rate**, which is the ratio between the amount credited to the Recipient's account (in the Destination Currency) and the amount debited from the Sender's account (in the Source Currency); **OR**
    
*   **Option (B) Other Fees + Defined Exchange Rate + ,** which shows the value of the fees to be deducted (shown in the Source Currency) and the effective exchange rate between the amount after deductions and the amount actually credited to the Recipient.
    

Subject to the requirements above, the exact amount of the Source PSP Deducted Fee (if charged) does not need to be disclosed. If Option (B) is chosen, the Source PSP Deducted Fee and other relevant fees can be combined and presented as one amount.

# MESSAGE acmt.023 Identification Verification Request | Nexus Payments Docs

The `acmt.023` message is used for:

*   (a) **proxy resolution requests** and
    
*   (b) **account resolution requests.**
    

The messages for both use cases are very similar, with only slightly different information being provided.

For further detail on each element in the `acmt.023` and `acmt.024`, please refer to the [Message Guidelines (Excel)](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-guidelines-excel)

Structure of the acmt.023 Identification Verification Request V03


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main blocks of the acmt.023 Identification Verification Request V03

The acmt.023 message has two main blocks:

*   **Assignment** contains information about who is making the request and where that request should be sent:
    
    *   **Creator** describes the Sender of the payment, who is initiating the proxy/account resolution request prior to sending a payment instruction
        
    *   **First Agent** and **Assigner** both describe the Source PSP, acting on behalf of the Creator (Sender)
        
    *   **Assignee** describes the entity that the request is assigned to. Depending on the local implementation, this will initially be set to the Source IPSO or Source Proxy Directory Operator (S-PDO).
        
    *   The element _Assignee > Agent > PostalAddress > Country_ **must** be set to the Destination Country as selected by the Sender. (This helps Nexus to route the request to the appropriate proxy directory.)
        
    *   Nexus will update the Assignee to the relevant Destination Proxy Directory Operator or Creditor Agent
        
    
*   **Verification** contains information about the proxy or account we are trying to verify
    
    *   The _**PartyAndAccountIdentification >**_ _**Account**_ element contains one of the following:
        
        *   An IBAN (_PartyAndAccountIdentification > Account > Identification > IBAN_)
            
        *   An account ID (which must be accompanies by a Financial Institution Identifier in the Agent block) (_PartyAndAccountVerification > Account > Identification > Other > Identification_)
            
        *   A ProxyId and ProxyType code (_PartyAndAccountIdentification > Account > Proxy > Identification and PartyAndAccountIdentification > Account > Proxy > Type > Code_ )
            
        
    *   In some cases (such as the Philippines) a proxy must be accompanied by the BIC of the financial institution in the Agent block. In this case, Nexus will include the BIC as one of the address inputs provided via the API call; the Source PSP does not need to implement custom logic for these cases).
        
    

circle-info

The _**PartyAndAccountIdentification > Party**_ block would be used for a **Comparison** model of verification, in which the Debtor has provided information about the Recipient, which can be sent to the Destination PSP. The Destination PSP will compare that information to the actual information they have on record, and reply either with a code that describes the degree of match, or with corrected information (assuming the original information was close enough). **This model is not currently supported in Nexus**, but may be developed in future.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.023-identification-verification-request#toc143525635)

Using acmt.023 for Proxy Resolution


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The proxy provided by the Sender should be included in the _Verification > PartyAndAccountIdentification > Account > Proxy_ element:
    
*   _Type_ should include the ISO 20022 _ExternalProxyAccountType1Code_ (eg _MBNO_) for the proxy type that was selected by the Sender. This code would have been provided by Nexus to the Source PSP when the Source PSP calls the GET /countries/{countryCode}/addressTypes option.
    
*   _Identification_ should include the actual proxy value, as text, as provided by the Sender (as entered into the Source PSP’s app)
    

circle-info

**Uniquely identifying the Debtor:** To allow the Proxy Directory Operator to guard against abuse (eg entering multiple phone numbers into a Nexus-enabled app in order to get the corresponding account holder names), the field _Assignment > Creator > Party_ > _Identification > PrivateIdentification > Other > Identification_ element **should** include a unique ID that uniquely identifies the Sender. To avoid sensitive data, this ID should ideally be a generated hash value that will be reused for all requests from this Sender. However, the Source PSP may instead provide an official ID (eg National Identity Number), an internal customer ID.

The PDO can (optionally) use this value to rate-limit the number of requests coming from a particular Sender. (This is recommended but not mandatory.)

Using acmt.023 for Account Resolution

*   The Account Identifier provided by the Sender should be included in the _Verification > PartyAndAccountIdentification > Account_ element
    
*   IBANs are included in the _Account > Id > IBAN_ element
    
*   Non-IBAN Account Identifiers should be given in _the Account > Id > Other > Id_ element
    
*   The PSP / Financial Institution Identifier provided by the Sender should be included in the _Verification > PartyAndAccountInformation > Agent_ section
    
    *   If a BIC is used, it should be given in _Agent > FinancialInstitutionIdentification > BICFI_ element
        
    *   If a non-BIC Financial Institution Identifier is used,
        
        *   The Financial Institution Identifier should be given in _Agent > ClearingSystemMemberIdentification > MemberIdentification_ element
            
        *   The _Agent > FinancialInstitutionIdentification > ClearingSystemMemberIdentification > ClearingSystemIdentification > Code_ element should be filled with the IPSO’s ExternalClearingSystemIdentification1Code (from the ISO 20022 External Code Set)
            
        
    

circle-info

IPSOs may not have requested an ExternalClearingSystemIdentification1Code in the ISO 20022 External Code Set. They will need to register a code before going live on Nexus.

Message transformation by Nexus

When an acmt.023 travels through Nexus, Nexus will update the Assignee as follows:

*   For proxy resolution requests, the Assignee will be updated to the relevant Destination IPS or Destination PDO depending on the local implementation OR
    
*   For account resolution requests, the Assignee will be updated to the Creditor Agent
    

No other transformations are made.

# Disputes | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/disputes#nexus-service-desk)

Nexus Service Desk


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus will provide a Service Desk which will contain a directory of every PSP in the Nexus network, along with the relevant operations, compliance and dispute officers for each PSP. The service desk will support the creation of tickets that can be assigned by one PSP to another PSP. This is a more reliable way of tracking and processing exceptions than manual communication channels such as email or telephone (although the directory will also contain contact details for the relevant officers).

Nominated staff of each PSP will be able to log into the Nexus Service Desk to register investigations, enquiries, recall requests and disputes. Once a case is created the service desk will automatically send a notification to the relevant officer at the relevant PSP.

In general, cases PSPs **should** work to resolve cases bilaterally, without involving the staff of the Nexus. However, NGP may monitor the average age and status of cases in the system and engage with PSPs who consistently fall below the expectations for responsiveness and resolution.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/disputes#logging-disputes)

Logging Disputes


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disputes should be logged in the Nexus Service Desk. The timelines for resolving disputes are defined in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook. Disputes can be raised by both the Sender and the Recipient of a transaction.

circle-exclamation

There are currently no Nexus ISO 20022 messages defined to send automated disputes.

According to the Nexus Scheme Rulebook, some disputes may be escalated to NGP. A PSP must request an escalation through the Service Desk.

# Investigation & Enquiry | Nexus Payments Docs

Investigations may be raised in two scenarios:

1.  When no `pacs.002` was received to update on the status of a payment
    
2.  When a `pacs.002` status was received, but the customer disagrees with the status.
    

In the second case, the Source PSP should raise an investigation via the Nexus Service Desk, referencing the UETR of the payment and tagging the Destination PSP.

In the first case, PSPs can resend the pacs.008 using the process below.

Investigating when no `pacs.002` payment status report was received

In the scenario where the Source PSP hasn’t received a response after the after the timeout defined in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook, the Source PSP is allowed to request an update by **resending the** `**pacs.008**`. This is an optional process which can be used by the Sending PSP to retrieve the status of a payment.

Each party must respond to a re-sent `pacs.008` as follows:

*   Check if they received the original `pacs.008` payment instruction
    
    *   If no `pacs.008` (with those specific Message ID and UETR elements) was received, respond with a `pacs.002` with status `RJCT`, rejecting the payment due to failure in the timestamp validation (<AccptncDtTm> too far in the past). The specific rejection reason to be used is `TM01`.
        
    *   If the original message was received:
        
        *   Check whether the party received a corresponding `pacs.002` with a final status (ie status codes `ACCC`, `RJCT`, `BLCK`)
            
            *   If yes, resend the `pacs.002` to the Source PSP
                
            *   If no, resend the `pacs.008` to the next party in the chain.

Differences against CBPR+

There are also the following notable differences against CBPR+:

*   Nexus uses the 2025 version of the ISO 20022 message (`pacs.008.001.13`) while CBPR+ uses an older version (`pacs.008.001.08`)
    
*   Group Header Changes:
    
    *   The Settlement Method of Nexus is defined as CLRG, but this value is removed from CPBR+ as not relevant.
        
    
*   Transaction Level Changes:
    
    *   Service Level is limited to three repetitions in CBPR+, while this is limited to 1 in Nexus
        
    *   CBPR+ has additional rules on the filling of postal address fields, (in line with CPMI recommendations) to maximise the granularity of postal address details. Nexus strongly recommends this approach but does not yet make it mandatory, meaning that Nexus will not reject a message that uses Address Line fields over dedicated StreetName, TownName, PostalCode elements.

# Translation To/From Domestic Message Formats | Nexus Payments Docs

All messages sent to Nexus or sent from Nexus **must** be in ISO 20022 format and must comply with the relevant Nexus usage guidelines.

However, not all IPSs use ISO 20022 for domestic payments. Where an IPS does not currently use ISO 20022 (or uses another message type or variation from Nexus), it **must** translate messages to be compliant with the Nexus Usage Guidelines **before** it sends the message to Nexus.

circle-exclamation

Nexus does not provide a message translation service; this must be handled by the IPS.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translation-to-from-domestic-message-formats#toc159257091)

Possible approaches to translations in a jurisdiction


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three broad approaches to translation, with pros and cons (which are discussed below).

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translation-to-from-domestic-message-formats#toc159257092)

Option 1: Enhance & Translate the Domestic Message

In most cases it will be necessary to enhance the domestic message format to allow it to carry the additional data required for a Nexus message. This additional data includes the Intermediary Agents (Source and Destination SAP), exchange rate, quote ID and (possibly) the UETR.

The IPS would then need to provide a translation service that translates message from the domestic message format to the Nexus message format, and vice versa.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translation-to-from-domestic-message-formats#toc159257093)

Option 2: Dual formats in parallel

In this case, the IPSO would **adapt the IPS and proxy directory to accept Nexus ISO 20022 messages** for cross-border proxy resolution, account resolution and payments, **while continuing to accept the domestic message format for domestic payments.**

The IPSO would adapt its system to also accept `pacs.008` requests and generate `pacs.002` responses for Nexus cross-border payments. The Proxy Directory Operator would adapt the proxy directory to accept `acmt.023` messages and respond with `acmt.024`.

PSPs who wish to make cross-border payments through Nexus would need to build in support for `pacs.008/pacs.002`, but could continue to use the domestic messages for domestic payments. PSPs who did not want to make payments through Nexus would not need to support `pacs.008/pacs.002`.

PSPs who wish to make cross-border proxy or account resolution requests through Nexus would need to build in support for `acmt.023/024`, but could continue to use the domestic messages for domestic proxy resolutions. PSPs who did not want to make payments through Nexus would not need to support `acmt.023/024`.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translation-to-from-domestic-message-formats#toc159257094)

Option 3: Full migration

The IPSO could mandate that all PSPs migrate to using the ISO 20022 messages for both domestic and cross-border proxy resolution, account resolution and payment instructions.

At some point the domestic proxy resolution messages would be retired/disabled. There may be a coexistence period when both message types are accepted.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translation-to-from-domestic-message-formats#toc159257095)

Pros and cons of different approaches


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are pros and cons of each approach, as outlined below.

**APPROACH**

**PROS**

**CONS**

**Option 1:** Full translation of enhanced domestic format

*   Minimises changes for domestic PSPs, who can continue to use the existing domestic messages
    
*   Translation can be done by the IPSOs, so that individual PSPs do not need to handle translation
    

*   Changes may still need to be made to the domestic message to support cross-border proxy resolution. If significant changes are needed, it may be better long-term to consider option 3.
    

**Option 2:** Dual formats in parallel

*   Changes only need to be made by PSPs when they onboard to Nexus, and do not affect PSPs who do not intend to use the service.
    

*   PSPs need to support two message types and apply logic to understand which type of message to send depending on the type of payment
    

**Option 3:** Full migration

*   Supports move to standardized ISO 20022 messages rather than bespoke _ISO 20022-like_ messages; aligned with the wider payments industry migration to ISO 20022.
    
*   PSPs who are present in multiple countries only have to support one message type for each function, rather than multiple non-standard domestic formats
    

*   Requires a significant domestic change program and testing to manage the migration
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translation-to-from-domestic-message-formats#toc159257096)

Translating the message body


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each message will have 2 translation points:

*   **Outbound** (from **domestic format** to **Nexus format**)
    
*   **Inbound** (from **Nexus format** to **domestic format**)
    

The table below shows the translation points for each message type currently supported in Nexus:

**MESSAGE TYPE**

**OUTBOUND** _From_ _Domestic_ > _To Nexus_

**INBOUND** _From Nexus_ > _To Domestic_

**pacs.008**

Source IPS > Nexus

Nexus > Destination IPS

**pacs.002**

Destination IPS > Nexus

Nexus > Source IPS

**acmt.023**

Source IPS > Nexus

DNexus > Destination IPS

**acmt.024**

Destination IPS > Nexus

Nexus > Source IPS

For each translation point, the IPSO must define a translation map.

# Purpose Codes | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/purpose-codes#toc159257064)

Use of purpose codes


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Purpose Codes** and _**Category**_ **Purpose Codes** (P/CP codes) are used in some jurisdictions for AML/CFT, capital flow measures (exchange controls), balance-of-payments calculations or other regulatory reporting reasons. Payments to those jurisdictions that do not provide a P/CP code may be rejected or may require manual processing.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/purpose-codes#toc159257065)

Challenges with traditional approaches to purpose codes

Typically each country uses their own domestic purpose code list, which is not harmonized between countries. This requires PSPs in each country to know the purpose code list of each other country, and to ask the Sender to select an appropriate code from the list before confirming the payment. In some cases, a Sender may have to select a code twice from two different lists (for the Source Country and Destination Country).

This approach is not suitable for Nexus payments. Instead, Nexus uses the harmonized ISO 20022 External Code Set codes for purpose and category purpose codes. This means that each PSP only needs to be able to map the domestic code list to the ISO 20022 code list, without having to know the domestic code list of every other country. (If the IPS uses translation then the IPS may do the mapping on the PSPs’ behalf.)

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/purpose-codes#toc159257066)

Rules around use of purpose codes in Nexus


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Nexus does **not** require the use of Purpose Codes or Category Purpose Codes (P/CP Codes).
    
    *   This is in line with the CPMI Harmonized ISO 20022 requirements.
        
    *   Nexus will **not** reject `pacs.008` payment instructions where the P/CP elements are left empty or null, or where the entire element is missing from the message structure.
        
    
2.  However, some Nexus-member jurisdictions **do** require the use of P/CP codes.
    
    *   Source PSPs **should** use P/CP codes when they are required in the Destination Country.
        
        *   Source PSPs are able to establish whether the receiving country requires a P/CP code or not by reviewing the response to the `GET /countries/` API.
            
        
    *   In the jurisdictions that do require P/CP codes, Destination PSPs **may** reject payments that do not include a Purpose Code and/or Category Purpose Code (rather than manually requesting further information from the Source PSP).
        
    

triangle-exclamation

Alternatively, a Destination PSP may choose to respond with an “Accepted without posting” (`ACWP`) status code, and follow up manually to get the correct purpose code from the Source PSP. This will delay the payment and add costs for both the Source and Destination PSPs, so should be avoided and is only allowed for non-time critical payments.

1.  A Source PSP **may** include P/CP codes even when they are not mandatory in the Destination Country
    
    *   A Destination PSP in a jurisdiction that does not use P/CP codes **must not** reject a message that does include a P/CP code. (The Destination PSP **may** ignore the P/CP code.)
        
    *   When in doubt, it is safer to provide a purpose code than to omit it.
        
    
2.  When a Nexus pacs.008 **does** include a P/CP code, it **must only** use a code from the **ISO 20022 External code set**.
    
    *   The relevant code types are **ExternalCategoryPurpose1Code** and **ExternalPurpose1Code.** (See table below.)
        
    *   PSPs **must not** use the Proprietary code element _(… > Purpose > Proprietary_ or … _\> CategoryPurpose > Proprietary_).
        
    *   PSPs **must not** put proprietary (domestic) codes into the _.. > CategoryPurpose > Code_ or ..Purpose > Code element
        
    
3.  The Category Purpose Code and the Purpose Code in the message are not used by Nexus in the processing logic and do not affect the payment process itself. However, a Destination PSP may consider the P/CP codes when deciding whether to accept a payment.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/purpose-codes#toc159257067)

Carrying purpose codes in the pacs.008


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pacs.008 message format used by Nexus contains two elements to carry this information:

**ELEMENT & PATH**

**EXTERNAL CODE SET**

**ISO 20022 DEFINITION**

**ISO 20022 OFFICIAL USAGE**

**Category Purpose Code** _(.. Category Purpose > Code)_

ExternalCategory-Purpose1Code (44 values)

_“Specifies the_ _**high-level purpose**_ _of the instruction based on a set of pre-defined categories.”_

_“This is used by the initiating party to provide information concerning the processing of the payment. It is likely_ _**to trigger special processing**_ _by any of the agents involved in the payment chain.”_

**Purpose Code** (.. > Purpose > Code)

**ExternalPurpose1Code (300+ values)**

_“Underlying reason for the payment transaction”_

_“Purpose is used by the end customers, that is initiating party, (ultimate) debtor, (ultimate) creditor to provide information concerning the nature of the payment. Purpose is a content element, which is_ _**not used for processing**_ _by any of the agents involved in the payment chain._

In principle, all purpose codes from the external code list are accepted, although some codes may not be relevant for Nexus use cases.

# Compatibility with Instant Payments Plus (IP+) | Nexus Payments Docs

Where ISO 20022 Instant Payment Plus (IP+) usage guidelines are followed as the standard for **domestic payments**, it is relatively **straightforward to build in compatibility with the Nexus usage guidelines.** This can be done in advance of joining Nexus as a way of future-proofing.

Firstly, the following pacs.008 elements, which are required in Nexus payments, should be made “optional” in the domestic standard so that there are no “do not use” restrictions or validations preventing the use of these elements in future:

*   **Interbank Settlement Date**
    
*   **Acceptance Date Time**
    
*   **Instructed Amount**
    
*   **Agreed Rate**
    
*   **Charges Information**
    
*   The use of **Previous Instructing** and **Instructed Agents**
    
*   The use of **Intermediary Agents** (used to identify the Source and Destination Settlement Account Providers)
    
*   The use of **Intermediary Agent Accounts** to identify the FX Provider's accounts at the SAPs
    

In addition to the above, we recommend the use of **structured address information** and purpose codes in line with CPMI, but this is not mandatory.

# Returns | Nexus Payments Docs

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/returns#toc163731074)

Returns via `pacs.008` (No support yet for `pacs.004`)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first release of Nexus will not support a dedicated payment return process. Instead, the Destination PSP **must** initiate a new Nexus payment to the Source PSP and Sender.

The Destination PSP can (but is not required to) reference the original payment in the payment message in the Structured Remittance information elements. Nexus will not try to correlate this against the original payment instruction from the Source PSP.

Note that typically, a Nexus payment is processed instantly. Returns should therefore be an exceptional case.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/returns#processing-returns-via-a-pacs.008-interim-measure)

Processing returns via a `pacs.008` (Interim measure)

Currently, when a payment needs to be returned to the Sender, the Destination PSP must request a new quote and then create a new Nexus payment. The return payment does not have to use the same FX Provider as the original payment, nor does it need to follow the same route (i.e. use the same Settlement Access Providers).

The Source IPS should submit the return payment as a Nexus `pacs.008` message. For Nexus, this is treated as a new payment, including for all validations and fees.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/returns#referencing-the-original-payment)

**Referencing the original payment**

When the Destination PSP wants to reference an earlier transaction, the original UETR can be included in the Additional Remittance Information prefixed with "NexusOrgnlUETR:" (in addition to a separate instance containing the new `NexusFXQuoteId`).

Copy

    <RmtInf>
        <Strd>

            </AddtlRmtInf>
        </Strd>
    </RmtInf>

Up to **three recurrences of the Additional Remittance Information element** are allowed in a Nexus message.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/returns#defining-the-amount-to-be-returned)

**Defining the amount to be returned**

In most cases, the exchange rates available in Nexus would have changed since the Source PSP sent the original payment instruction. This will result in either the Source PSP or Destination PSP making a loss or gain as a result of the change in FX rates.

To ensure fairness, this must be handled as follows:

#### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/returns#scenario-1-source-psp-at-fault)

**Scenario 1: Source PSP at fault**

*   The Source PSP may be at fault if (for example) the payment was sent in error, fraudulent, or the Sender requested the return.
    
*   In this case, the **Source PSP** takes the FX risk
    
*   The Destination PSP should send back exactly the amount they received in the Destination Currency.
    
    *   The D-PSP is allowed to deduct a reasonable amount as administrative fee from the amount to be returned.
        
    *   The Destination PSP can do this by requesting a quote from the Nexus Quotes API, specifying the amount to return denominated in the Destination currency.
        
    
*   The amount requested should be the same as the Destination PSP originally received from the Destination SAP (ie the Interbank Settlement Amount in the `pacs.008` processed by the Destination IPS, in the Destination Currency), minus any fee that the D-PSP charges for processing the return
    
*   The Destination PSP must debit the Creditor by the full amount originally credited to the Creditor’s account.
    
*   The Source PSP may receive more or less than it originally sent to the Destination PSP, due to the change in exchange rates.
    
*   Because the return is using a normal pacs.008 payment instruction:
    
    *   The original Source PSP becomes the new Destination PSP and must deduct the D-PSP fee (according to the standard formula in Nexus)
        
    *   The original Source PSP may not recognize that the payment is a return, and so may process it as per a normal payment
        
    
*   The Source PSP may choose to reimburse (credit) the Sender for the amount originally debited from their account (ie the Source PSP absorbs the FX risk, whether losses or gains)
    
    *   Alternatively the Source PSP may choose to credit the Sender the amount actually received in the return payment (ie passing the FX risk onto the Debtor).
        
    

#### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/returns#scenario-2-destination-psp-at-fault)

**Scenario 2: Destination PSP at fault**

*   The Destination PSP may be at fault if (for example) they accepted a payment but then later decided that they should have rejected it, or if the Recipient refuses the payment.
    
*   In this case the Destination PSP must take the FX risk
    
*   The Destination PSP must return exactly the amount the Source PSP sent, in the Source currency
    
*   The Destination PSP can do this by requesting a quote from the Nexus Quotes API, specifying the amount to return denominated in the Source currency
    
    *   The amount to request can be calculated by taking the Interbank Settlement Amount (in Destination Currency) from the original pacs.008 and _dividing_ it by the Exchange Rate.
        
    
*   The amount the Destination PSP needs to return to the Source PSP may be more or less than the amount originally received from the Source PSP, due to changes in FX rates.
    
*   The Destination PSP must debit the Creditor by the full amount originally credited to the Creditor’s account.
    
*   The Destination PSP (and not the Creditor) takes any FX risk if the amount that must be returned to the Source PSP is greater than the amount that was originally received from the Source PSP.
    

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/unsuccessful-payments-exceptions/returns#compensation-for-processing-returns)

Compensation for processing returns


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a return is initiated by the Destination PSP, the payment must be returned including the Destination PSP fee.

When a return is the result of a request by the Source PSP, the Destination PSP is allowed to deduct a reasonable amount as administrative fee from the amount to be returned. It is up to the Source PSP whether they pass the return fees onto the end-customer or reimburse the customer fully.

Note that the party that takes the FX risk may in fact benefit if the exchange rate has moved in their favour. Over a number of return payments (which are themselves rare) the losses and gains are likely to net out and any overall loss will be negligible.

# Processing payments as an SAP | Nexus Payments Docs

The payment process is described in detail in [Payment Flow](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-flow-happy-path)
. This section will detail the specifics for the Source and Destination Settlement Access Providers.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap#toc163730751)

Role of SAPs in a specific Nexus payment


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus processes payments from the Source PSP to the Destination PSP via two Instant Payment Systems (IPSs). The Nexus payment is settled in each IPS between the respective PSP and SAP.

For a specific payment, a SAP will play one of two roles: as Source SAP, or as Destination SAP.

circle-info

In these examples, we assume that the FXP is not a member of either IPS and so uses both a Source SAP and a Destination SAP, as shown in the diagram below. See [Accessing Instant Payment Systems](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/fx-provision/accessing-instant-payment-systems)
 for alternative scenarios where the FXP has IPS membership in one or both countries.

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-22c587a59908c578fdb9c41dce01374a7fd6310f%252Fimage%2520%281%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=4dafa374&sv=2)

An FXP that is not a participant in an IPS can make use of Settlement Access Providers

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap#toc163730752)

When acting as Source SAP

The **Source Settlement Access Provider (S-SAP)** is a member of the Source IPS. It provides an account to the FXP, denominated in the Source currency.

*   The Source PSP sends funds (in the Source Currency) to the FX Provider’s account at the S-SAP.
    
*   This payment is processed through the Source IPS, which debits the Source PSP and credits the Source SAP.
    
*   The Source SAP will in turn credit the FXP’s account.
    

The process flow for a Source SAP is almost equal to that of a regular Destination PSP, so **any PSP which is able to accept Nexus payments in the role of Destinatoin PSP should be able to perform the role of a Source Settlement Access Provider**, with minimal changes:

*   The **S-SAP is not allowed to deduct any fees** from the amount transferred, while the D-PSP must deduct the Destination PSP fee.
    
    *   The S-SAP must credit the FXP with exactly the amount received from the S-PSP.
        
    
*   For each specific `pacs.008` payment instruction, the S-SAP is able to recognize it acts as the S-SAP and not the D-PSP because the Nexus `pacs.008` references the S-SAP as the _Intermediary Agent 1,_ while the D-PSP is referenced as Creditor Agent.
    
    *   Where an IPS uses a domestic message format that differs from the Nexus standard `pacs.008` payment instruction, an SAP must refer to the IPS’s documentation to understand how the SAP will be described in the message. The SAP must ensure it can distinguish between receiving a Nexus payment as S-SAP and receiving a payment as a D-PSP, and handle the payments accordingly.
        
    
*   In the specific case the Source IPS is designed to use a [**4-leg settlement process**](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/annex-4-step-vs-5-step-processes-in-domestic-clearing-and-settlement)
    , when a payment is rejected in the D-IPS, the settlement will be reversed in the Source IPS.
    
    *   In this case, the S-SAP **must** reverse the credit on the FXP’s account. (Note that this requirement may already be in place for domestic payments.)
        
    *   This does not apply to a [5-leg settlement process](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/annex-4-step-vs-5-step-processes-in-domestic-clearing-and-settlement)
        , as in this case the Source SAP will not credit the FXP’s account until the settlement confirmation is received from the Destination IPS.
        
    

**Similarities and Differences Between S-SAP and D-PSP**

**Source SAP**

**Destination PSP**

**Settlement**

S-SAP is credited in the local settlement cycle

Must be able to confirm or reject ALL incoming payments in real-time.

In the case that the local IPS uses a [4-step settlement](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/annex-4-step-vs-5-step-processes-in-domestic-clearing-and-settlement)
 process in the local IPS, the S-SAP must be able to reverse the credit on the FXP’s account in case of a reject from the D-IPS.

D-PSP is credited in the local settlement cycle.

**Agent in the Nexus** `**pacs.008**` **payment instruction**

Intermediary Agent 1

Creditor Agent

**Fees**

S-SAP must not make any deductions from the payment amount. Any fees to the FXP must be invoiced to the FXP separately.

D-PSP must deduct the Destination PSP fee before crediting the Creditor Account

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap#toc163730753)

When acting as Destination SAP


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Destination Settlement Access Provider (D-SAP)** is a member of the Destination IPS. It provides an account to the FXP (or Source PSP in cases where the PSP wishes to manage their own FX) denominated in the Destination currency.

*   The D-SAP will debit the FXP’s account at the D-SAP upon receiving the payment instruction from Nexus
    
*   The D-SAP will then send funds (in the Destination Currency) to the Destination PSP’s account
    
*   This payment is processed through the Destination IPS, who debits the D-SAP and credits the D-PSP
    

The process flow for a Destination SAP is almost equal to that of a Source PSP. In both cases, a payment instruction is to be validated and debited; in the case of the S-PSP the value is debited from the Sender (Debtor); in the case of the D-SAP the value is debited from the account of the FXP. **A PSP able to initiate Nexus payments would be able to perform the role of a D-SAP**, with minimal changes:

*   **The D-SAP must apply any fees to the payment amount.**
    
    *   The D-SAP must debit the FXP exactly the amount to be transferred (without adding fees).
        
    *   The D-SAP must transfer the full amount (as defined in the Interbank Settlement Amount field) to the D-PSP, without deductions.
        
    
*   The D-SAP may charge the FXP a separate transaction fee, according to their bilateral agreement.
    
*   In the Nexus message implementation, the D-SAP is identified as the Intermediary Agent.
    
    *   Where an IPS uses a domestic message format that differs from the Nexus standard `pacs.008` payment instruction, the SAP must refer to the IPS’s documentation to understand how it (the SAP) will be described in the message.
        
    
*   A D-SAP will receive the Nexus payment instruction from the D-IPS instead of via its own mobile app or internet banking channels (as would be the case for the S-PSP). The message may be `pacs.008` message, depending on the local IPS implementation of Nexus. (See [How the Destination IPS initiates the payment via the Destination SAP](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap/how-the-destination-ips-initiates-the-payment-via-the-destination-sap)
     for further details.)
    

**Similarities and Differences Between Destination SAP and Source PSP**

**Source PSP**

**Destination SAP**

**Settlement**

Debits the Sender before submitting the payment instruction to the S-IPS.

Receives instruction to debit FXP’s account via Nexus/D-IPS.

The message used for payment initiation can either be a Nexus `pacs.008` message or a local format (depending on the local Nexus implementation).

D-SAP instructs D-IPS to credit the D-PSP.

**Agent in the Nexus** `**pacs.008**` **payment instruction**

Debtor Agent

Intermediary Agent

**Fees**

Has specific rules around handling and disclosing fees.

Must not deduct fees from the value being transferred.

circle-info

The role of a D-SAP is also very comparable to PSPs providing sponsored access to indirect participants or EMIs. In that case, the PSP processes payments on behalf of the indirect participant or EMI; in the Nexus case, the SAP processes the payment on behalf of the FXP. **PSPs who provide sponsored access should be able to act as a D-SAP with minimal to no change** (depending on the local setup of the IPS involved).

# Translating To/From ISO 20022 Codes | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-exclamation

Even countries that use ISO 20022 for domestic payments may make use of proprietary code sets for status reasons, proxy types, category purpose codes etc. These will need to be translated to the relevant code from the [ISO 20022 External Code Setarrow-up-right](https://www.iso20022.org/catalogue-messages/additional-content-messages/external-code-sets)
.

Nexus messages **must only** use codes from the ISO 20022 External Code Set.

**Nexus will reject codes that are not listed** in the ISO 20022 External Code Set.

When the domestic message format uses proprietary codes, an IPSO has three options:

1.  The proprietary codes can be translated to/from the ISO 20022 External Code Set codes, OR
    
2.  The domestic message format can be updated to allow use of the ISO 20022 External Code Set codes, _in parallel_ to proprietary codes, OR
    
3.  The country can migrate to using the External Code Set (this supports cross-border interoperability beyond Nexus)
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translating-to-from-iso-20022-codes#toc159257098)

Code sets to translate

For the currently supported message set, the code sets that may need to be translated to domestic proprietary codes (and vice versa) are:

*   _ExternalProxyAccountType1Code_
    
*   _ExternalStatusReason1Code_
    
*   _ExternalVerificationReason1Code_
    
*   _ExternalClearingSystemIdentification1Code_
    
*   _ExternalCategoryPurpose1Code_
    
*   _ExternalPurpose1Code._
    

#### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translating-to-from-iso-20022-codes#toc159257099)

Defining the code translation maps

For each code set, two types of translation map are required:

*   Inbound, from the ISO 20022 code list to the domestic equivalent
    
*   Outbound, from the domestic code list to the ISO 20022 code list equivalent
    

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-57a8104d93de0386450859cb0362a131570700bb%252F3%2520%288%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=f114daff&sv=2)

The **mapping rules** are as follows:

*   **Rule 1:** Every code in the input list must unambiguously map to one (and only one) code in the output list.
    
    *   Consequently, a specific code in the input list cannot map to multiple codes in the output list. This rule is to prevent ambiguity about how the code should be translated.
        
    
*   **Rule 2:** Multiple codes in the input list can map to the same code in the output list
    
*   **Rule 3:** Not every code in the output list needs to have a corresponding code on the input list. (See “Restricting a code set” below.)
    

The diagram below shows examples of each of these cases.

Rules for mapping ISO 20022 code sets to domestic code sets, and vice versa

When doing this mapping, efforts should be made to maintain the level of specificity and granularity between the domestic and ISO 20022 code list.

**OUTBOUND translation map (Domestic Format > Nexus ISO 20022)**

*   The domestic list (input list) **may** be restricted to a subset of the full list
    
    *   PSPs in a jurisdiction can be instructed to use only the relevant subset of domestic codes that are likely to apply to Nexus payments
        
    
*   The ISO 20022 list (output list) **may** be restricted
    
    *   It is not necessary to use every code in the ISO 20022 code list. This means that some ISO 20022 output codes will have no corresponding domestic input code (in the outbound translation map).
        
    

**INBOUND translation map (ISO 20022 > Domestic)**

*   The ISO 20022 External Codes list (input list) **must not** be restricted
    
    *   Every ISO 20022 input code in the required code set must be mapped to an output code in the domestic list
        
        *   This is because Nexus cannot restrict other jurisdictions’ use of the full ISO 20022 code set, and so it is possible that an inbound payment could use any of the ISO 20022 codes in a particular code set
            
        
    *   It is acceptable to manually map the codes most applicable to Nexus payments, and then select a default “other” code for all other ISO 20022 codes.
        
    
*   The domestic code list (output list) **may** be restricted
    
    *   It is not necessary to use every code in the domestic list. So some output codes will have no corresponding input code.
        
    *   The domestic list could be restricted to codes that are relevant to Nexus use cases.

Specific issues: translating Proxy codes


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus `acmt.023` and `acmt.024` messages uses codes from the ISO 20022 External Code Set. For example, the _ExternalProxyAccountType1Code_ for mobile phone number is “MBNO”. (Domestically, some countries use “MSISDN” (the technical term used in telecoms for a mobile number) or a numerical code such as “01”.)

*   For the **Inbound Proxy Resolution Request** (ie. a proxy resolution request initiated in another country, relating to a Recipient in your country), the _ExternalProxyAccountType1Code_ can be translated to your domestic equivalent. For example, _MBNO_ could be translated to the domestic “MSISDN” so that it can be understood by the Domestic Proxy Directory.
    
    *   (Alternatively the Domestic Proxy Directory could be adapted to understand that _MBNO_ and _MSISDN_ are the same type of proxy.)
        
    
*   However, special care is required for the **Outbound Proxy Resolution Request** (a request initiated by a Sender/Debtor in your country relating to a Creditor in another country):
    
    *   The Source PSP will use the Nexus APIs to retrieve the full list of proxy types available in the Destination Country; this API will return the proxy types with associated _ExternalProxyAccountType1Codes_.
        
    *   **These codes should not be translated to the domestic equivalent.** This is because the Destination Country may support proxy types that are not supported in your country, and therefore there will be no domestic equivalent to translate to.
        
    

triangle-exclamation

**The domestic message format must support the full set of ISO 20022** _**ExternalProxyAccountType1Codes**_: This means that the domestic message format **must** be adapted to allow all ExternalProxyAccountType1 codes as valid values.

chevron-rightExample[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translating-to-from-iso-20022-codes#example)

Email addresses can be used as proxies in Indonesia, but not Singapore.

If a Singaporean wishes to send a payment to Indonesia using the Recipient's email address, the Singaporean IPS must accept the ExternalProxyAccountType1Code `EMAL` as a valid proxy type, even though they would not recognise it as a valid proxy code for domestic payments. The Source PSP must ensure that it does not reject the email address given as an invalid proxy.

Specific issues: translating Purpose Codes


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a country uses domestic Purpose or Category Purpose (P/CP) codes, these codes must be mapped and translated to the ISO 20022 External Code Set.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translating-to-from-iso-20022-codes#toc159257103)

Regulator-led definition of translation maps

Nexus strongly recommends that the mapping for both the Category Purpose Code and the Purpose Code to the domestic purpose code list should be **defined by - or at least approved by - the local regulator**, to:

*   ensure standardization of the mapping across all domestic PSPs
    
*   avoid duplication of effort by domestic PSPs
    
*   alleviate worry by PSPs and/or the IPS about misjudging equivalence of domestic and ISO 20022 codes.
    

circle-info

A standard mapping provided by the regulator is also useful for other non-Nexus cross-border payments and could lower costs of migration to ISO 20022 across the industry.

ISO 20022 messages are submitted to Nexus via asynchronous API.

The ISO 20022 XML message itself will be included in full in the message body.

The Source IPSO will also define an endpoint to which Nexus should send the resulting response (ie when submitting acmt.023, the Source IPSO must also define the acmt024Endpoint to which Nexus should send the acmt.024 response).

# MESSAGE: pacs.008 FI to FI Customer Credit Transfer | Nexus Payments Docs

The ISO 20022 `pacs.008` message is used in Nexus as the payment instruction.

For further detail on each element in the `pacs.008`, please refer to the [Message Guidelines (Excel)](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-guidelines-excel)
.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257059)

Intermediary Agents


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Intermediary Agent** elements of the pacs.008 are used define the Settlement Account Providers (SAPs) at which an FX Provider holds their funds. Payments flow from the Source PSP to the Source SAP, and then from the Destination SAP to the Destination PSP.

Source PSPs use the API operation `GET /quotes/{quoteId}/intermediary-agents` to retrieve details of the intermediary agents, and then copy this information into the `pacs.008a` as required by the message specifications. (The information may alternatively be retrieved from the response to the original `GET /quotes` request.)

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257060)

Agreed Rate


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The exchange rate is recorded in the element:

_… > Credit Transfer Transaction Information > Agreed Rate_

This is the **exchange rate that the FXP charges to the Source PSP**. It is applied to `Interbank Settlement Amount` in the Source Currency, to determine what should be debited from the Destination SAP and transferred to the Destination PSP in the destination currency.

circle-exclamation

Note that this exchange rate is not the same as the _effective_ exchange rate that is shown to the Sender, which is calculated by dividing the amount credited to the Recipient by the amount debited from the Sender.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc159257061)

Amounts


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The information about amounts included in the Nexus payment elements (in bold) as follows:
    
    *   **Instructed Amount** = the amount instructed by the Sender in either Source Currency (amount debited from the Sender) or Destination currency (amount to be credited to Recipient). When the amount is specified in the Source Currency, the amount includes all fees (i.e. is the actual amount debited from the Debtor account, incl. the S-PSP fee). When the amount is specified in the Destination Currency, this exludes the fees (i.e. the amount is the amount credited onto the Creditor account and thus excludes the D-PSP fee).
        
    *   **Interbank Settlement Amount (in Source Currency)** = the amount transferred from the Source PSP to the Source SAP. If the instructed amount is denominated in the Source Currency, the interbank settlement amount is equal to the instructed amount minus the Source PSP fee. If the instructed amount is denominated in the Destination Currency, the interbank settlement amount (in Source Currency) is equal to the instructed amount plus the D-PSP fee converted to Source Currency using the exchange rate.
        
    *   **Interbank Settlement Amount (in Destination Currency)** = the amount transferred from the Destination SAP to the Destination PSP. This is calculated by Nexus before the payment is sent to the Destination IPS. This is the `Interbank Settlement Amount` in the Source Currency multiplied by the `Exchange Rate` applicable to the transaction (based on the quote received from the FX Provider)
        
    *   **The amount credited to the Recipient** is calculated by taking the Interbank Settlement Amount (in Destination Currency) and deducting the Destination PSP Deducted Fee, which is recorded in `ChargesInformation/Amount` (see below). Nexus calculates and provides the applicable Destination PSP fee in the response to the `GET /quotes/` API (or the `GET /creditor-agent-fee` API - see [Fees](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees)
         for further information.

Charges Information


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fees deducted by the Source PSP and Destination PSP must be recorded in the Charges section of the `pacs.008` payment instruction; see [Fees](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/fees)
 for further details. (The complete fee model and the requirements are detailed in the Nexus Scheme Rulebook.)

*   The Source PSP **may** charge a Deducted Fee by making a deduction from the amount debited from the Sender.
    
    *   The Source PSP Deducted Fee is by definition the difference between _Instructed Amount_ and _Interbank Settlement Amount._
        
    
*   The Destination PSP **must** charge a Deducted Fee before crediting the Recipient.
    
    *   The Destination PSP is determined according to a formula set by the Nexus Scheme, and is calculated by Nexus and shared with the Source PSP when they call the `GET /quotes` API operation (or a separate `GET /creditor-agent-fee` in the case that the Source PSP is also the FX Provider.
        
    

Both of these fees **must** be recorded (by the Source PSP) in the `pacs.008` payment instruction as follows:

*   _FI To FI Customer Credit Transfer > Credit Transfer Transaction Information >_
    
    *   _Charge Bearer_ = SHA_R_
        
    *   _Charges Information \[1\]_
        
        *   _Agent_ = Source PSP
            
        *   _Amount_ = Source PSP Deducted Fee
            
            *   (Ccy = Source Currency)
                
            
        
    *   Charges Information _\[2\]_
        
        *   _Agent_ = Destination PSP
            
        *   _Agent_ = Destination PSP Deducted Fee
            
            *   (Ccy = Destination Currency)
                
            
        
    

circle-info

If the Source PSP chooses not to charge the Source PSP Deducted Fee, it should still include the Charges Amount information with the amount set to zero.

Remittance Information


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus message guidelines permit the use of both the structured and unstructured remittance elements. The remittance elements cater for 140 characters of unstructured data, or structured remittance data. Nexus forwards the remittance elements unaltered.

The **Structured Remittance** element enables automated reconciliation by the Recipient between receivables and payments. It is recommended that the Recipient adopts the ISO 11649 Standard for a ‘structured creditor reference to the remittance information’ as the preferred remittance data convention for identifying payment referring to a single invoice.

The remittance data supplied by the Sender in the Nexus transaction **must** be forwarded in full and without alteration by the Source PSP, the SAPs involved and the IPSOs, to the Destination PSP.

When the Sender provides a **Structured Creditor Reference**, it is recommended that the Source PSP checks the correctness of the Structured Creditor Reference at the point of capture by the Sender.

The Destination PSP must also deliver received remittance data in full and without alteration to the Creditor.

FX Quote ID


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Quote Id is provided by the response to the `GET /quotes` API operation. The quote ID is a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). The `Quote ID` is to be supplied in the Agreed Rate section of the pacs.008 message.

The presence of the `Quote ID` is validated by Nexus and is used by Nexus to validate the exchange rate applied to the payment and enrich the message with the intermediary agents as required.

circle-info

If no `Quote ID` is present, Nexus will validate that the Source PSP “owns” or has right to make payments from the Destination SAP, as defined in the `Intermediary Agent 2` block.)

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-pacs.008-fi-to-fi-customer-credit-transfer#toc150871079)

Message Transformation by Nexus


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus must transform certain values in the `pacs.008` before it is sent to the Destination Country:

*   Clearing System – updated from the Source IPS to the Destination IPS
    
*   Interbank Settlement Amount – converted from the source currency amount to the Destination Currency Amount, at the exchange rate defined in the message (and validated against the original FX Quote ID)
    

Nexus also updates the position of the following parties in the `pacs.008` to create an instruction that can be processed by the Destination IPS:

**Element in pacs.008 message**

**Party defined in Source Leg**

**Party defined in Destination Leg**

# MESSAGE acmt.024 Identification Verification Report | Nexus Payments Docs

The `acmt.024` is the response to the `acmt.023` proxy resolution or account resolution request.

For further detail on each element in the `acmt.023` and `acmt.024`, please refer to the [Message Guidelines (Excel)](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-guidelines-excel)

Main blocks of the acmt.024 Identification Verification Request

The `acmt.024` is also split into two blocks:

*   Similarly to the `acmt.023` message, the `acmt.024` the **Assignment** block contains information about who is making the request and providing the response
    
    *   **Creator** remains the same as the `acmt.023`, describing the Sender who made the original proxy or account resolution request
        
    *   **First Agent** remains the same as the `acmt.023`, describing the Source PSP
        
    *   **Assigner** changes to the Destination Proxy Directory Operator
        
    *   **Assignee** changes to the Source PSP (ie is the same as First Agent)
        
    
*   The **Report** block contains the information about the Recipient:
    
    *   **Verification** is either _true_ (if the payment can proceed) or _false_ (if any error means that the payment cannot proceed)
        
    *   **Reason** will only be filled if Verification is false, and will contain an error code explaining why the verification failed (eg proxy not registered). (See [Error codes](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-acmt.024-identification-verification-report#toc143525641)
         _below_).
        
    *   **OriginalPartyAndAccountIdentification** is an exact copy of the “PartyAndAccountIdentification” from the `acmt.023`
        
    *   **UpdatedPartyAndAccountIdentification** is where the updated information (from either the Proxy Directory or the Destination PSP) is provided

acmt.024 for Proxy Resolution


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a proxy resolution request, the Destination PSP should add the following information to the _UpdatedPartyAndAccountIdentification_ block:

*   _… > Party > Name –_ this is the verified name of the account holder, in full. It can be used by the Source PSP for sanctions screening.
    
*   _… > Account > Identification > IBAN or Account > Identification > Other > Identification -_ this identifies the specific account of the Recipient/Creditor
    
*   _… > Account > Name_ (in Nexus this is the display name of the Recipient, which can be shown to the Sender)
    
*   _… > .Agent > FinancialInstitutionIdentification > BICFI_ (or _Agent > FinancialInstitutionIdentification > ClearingSystemMemberIdentification > MemberIdentification_, for non-BIC IDs)

acmt.024 for Account Resolution


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For an account resolution, the Destination PSP should add the following information added to the _UpdatedPartyAndAccountIdentification_ block:

*   _… > Party > Name_
    
*   _… > Party > PostalAddress_
    
    *   At least Country and Town Name should be provided here, to support with sanctions screening and other compliance checks and to ensure alignment with the [CPMI’s ISO 20022 harmonization requirementsarrow-up-right](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d218.htm)
        .
        
    
*   (Optional) _Party > Identification > PrivateIdentification > DateAndPlaceOfBirth_
    
    *   This is optional but can help to reduce false alerts against sanctions screening lists
        
    
*   _Account > Name_
    
    *   To be used as the display name shown to the Sender, to enable confirmation of payee. This display name can be partially masked.

Message transformation by Nexus


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an `acmt.024` travels through Nexus, Nexus will update the Assignee to the Id of the Source PSP. This is the only change.

Error codes


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there is an error either with proxy resolution or account resolution, an `acmt.024` should be sent:

*   The element _… > Report > Verification_ should be set to false
    
*   The element _… > Report > Reason > Code_ should be set to the appropriate error code from the table below
    

Error codes are taken from the ISO 20022 External Code Set.

The standard `acmt.024` [Message Guidelines (Excel)](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/message-guidelines-excel)
 specify that error codes must be from the **ExternalVerificationReason1Code** set, but there are only 3 codes in this set and they are insufficient. For that reason, we propose to also permit codes from **the ExternalStatusReason1Code** set, with the following limited code set:

**Process Step**

**Specific Requirements**

1

The **Sender** initiates and authorizes a Nexus cross-border payment.

The Sender has full transparency on the amount to be credited to the Recipient.

2

The **Source PSP** debits the Sender’s account or reserves the funds against the Sender's account balance.

The Source PSP must ensure the Sender has sufficient funds and must ensure the payment will be honoured, either by debiting the Sender’s account or by making a reservation of the funds on the account.

3

The **Source PSP** sends the payment instruction to the Source IPS.

There are no Nexus requirements on the format of the domestic payment message. The IPS must ensure the used payment message format contains sufficient data to cater for a Nexus payment message to be sent to the Nexus gateway. For full details of the Nexus requirements, see [Messaging & Translation](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/key-points)

4

The **Source IPS** ensures settlement (by reserving the pre-funded balance of the Source PSP or otherwise).

The Source IPS must ensure settlement certainty. There is no requirement for Nexus how to do this (either by settling the transaction, making a reservation against a prefund or otherwise). (See [Ensuring settlement certainty](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/ensuring-settlement-certainty)
.)

The Source IPS will also need to ensure a potential reject can be processed, even in the case of a settled transaction and in case of issues with other participants (eg lack of funds at the Source SAP, default of one of the participants, etc).

5

The **Source IPS** sends the payment instruction to the Source SAP for validation.

6

The **Source SAP** reviews the payment instruction. As this is a cross-border payment, it may need to also apply sanctions screening, if required by local legislation.

7

If the Source SAP is happy to accept the payment on behalf of the FXP (its customer), the Source SAP will respond with a payment status message to confirming that it will accept the payment.

Nexus does not prescribe the format of the domestic payment status confirmation message.

The IPS will monitor the response times of the Source SAP to ensure the response falls within the SLA.

In case of a reject, the IPS will release the reservation on the settlement and confirm the reject to the Source PSP.

8

The **Source IPS** sends a Nexus `pacs.008` payment instruction message to **Nexus.**

Unlike a domestic payment, the Source IPS would not send a confirmation to the Source PSP yet. Instead, it waits to receive the response from Nexus.

Some IPSs may still choose to send a `pacs.002` with a status code that informs the PSP that the payment has successfully been sent to Nexus. This would be at the discretion of the IPS and is not required or specified by Nexus. If the Source IPS does not use the Nexus ISO 20022 messages domestically, it needs to translate them at this point.

9

The **Nexus** validates and transforms the payment instruction to prepare it for the second leg by:

*   changing the instructing and instructed agents to the Destination SAP and Destination PSP respectively
    
*   validating the quote that is referenced, updating the currency and applying the currency conversion to the “Interbank Settlement Amount”.
    

**Nexus** then forwards the payment instruction to the Destination IPS.

10

The Nexus `pacs.008` is processed on the Destination side

(See [Detailed Flow in Destination Country (Receiving)](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/payment-processing/payment-flow-happy-path/detailed-flow-in-destination-country-receiving)
 for more details.)

11

The Destination Nexus Gateway sends the result from the Destination IPS processing in a Nexus `pacs.002` payment status report to the Source Nexus Gateway

12

The Source Nexus Gateway forwards the `pacs.002` payment status report message to the Source IPS.

If the Source IPS does not use ISO 20022 to communicate with its participants, it may translate the `pacs.002` at this point.

13

The **Source Gateway** informs the **FXP** that a payment has been processed using their quote; this is important to enable the FXP to keep track of their liquidity.

The FXP may also be separately updated of their account balances by the Source SAP and Destination SAP.

14

The Source IPS will finalise the payment between the Source PSP and Source SAP by updating the settlement obligations.

15

The Source IPS will send the Source PSP a confirmation that the payment has been successful.

16

The Source PSP can no finalize the debit on the Sender's account

17

The **Source PSP** informs their **Sender** that the payment is complete.

18

In case of a reject, the Source IPS will undo the settlement reservation.

19

The Source IPS informs the Source SAP the payment has been rejected and the credit on the FXP account must be reversed.

20

The Source IPS informs the Source PSP the payment is rejected

21

The Source SAP reverses the credit on the FXPs account

22

The Source PSP releases the reservation on the Senders account, or, in case the account was debited, credits the account with the exact amount it was debited.

23

The Source PSP informs the Sender of the reject.

# Detailed Flow in Destination Country (Receiving) | Nexus Payments Docs

The Destination Country processing flow is shown below, split between a 4-step clearing, 5-step clearing for normal priority payments and 5-step for high priority payments:

![](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F260996932-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FdlTzGEXDmi664xppppmm%252Fuploads%252FRHwyKvZGrpikcQJHPCCk%252F4-leg%2520destination%2520side.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D382e2fd2-9519-44d0-9fcd-52fe13f0f8eb&width=768&dpr=3&quality=100&sign=24bdebb7&sv=2)

1

The **Destination Nexus Gateway** sends the Nexus `pacs.008` to the **Destination IPS**.

The Destination IPS may need to convert this message into its local format before forwarding this to the Destination SAP.

2

The **Destination IPS** sends the payment instruction to the **Destination SAP**

The IPS is free to decide on the format of the payment message for the interaction towards the D-SAP and the D-PSP.

If ISO 20022 is not used domestically, the IPS will need to translate from the Nexus pacs.008 to the domestic payment instruction format.

3

The **Destination SAP** confirms that the **FX Provider** has sufficient funds with them and applies sanctions screening and compliance checks if required.

If the **Destination SAP** is happy to proceed with the payment, it will reserve the amount on the **FXP**’s account with them. If the Destination SAP is not able to validate the payment, the Destination SAP can reject the transaction.

4

The D-SAP either submits the payment instruction message to the Destination IPS, effectively giving the IPS the instruction to make payment to the Destination PSP or reject the transaction.

10

In case of a confirmation and successful settlement, the D-IPS will confirm settlement to the Destination SAP.

11

The D-IPS will confirm settlement to the Destination Nexus Gateway via a Nexus pacs.002 message.

The Destination IPS must use the Nexus pacs.002 payment status report format to confirm the transaction to the Nexus Gateway. See [Messaging & Translation](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/key-points)
for details on the format.

12

The Destination SAP can now finalize the debit on the FXP account.

13

The Destination Nexus Gateway will confirm receipt of the Nexus pacs.002 message. This is an optional message.

14

In case the Destination PSP is not able to credit the Recipient, the Destination PSP will send a pacs.002 reject back to the Destination IPS.

15

Upon receiving the reject from the Destination PSP, the Destination IPS will reverse the settlement reservation.

16

The Destination IPS will inform the Destination SAP of the reject by sending a pacs.002.

17

The Destination IPS will inform the Destination Nexus Gateway of the reject by sending a Nexus pacs.002.

18

Upon receing the pacs.002 rejection from the Destination IPS, the Destination SAP will release the reservation on the FXPs account.

19

The Nexus Destination Gateway will confirm receipt of the Nexus pacs.002. This confirmation is an optional message.

If the **Destination SAP** is happy to proceed with the payment, it will reserve the amount on the **FXP**’s account with them. If the Destination SAP is not able to validate the payment, the Destination SAP can reject the transaction.

4

The D-SAP either submits the payment instruction message to the Destination IPS, effectively giving the IPS the instruction to make payment to the Destination PSP or reject the transaction.

5

The **Destination IPS**, upon receiving the validated instruction from the Destination SAP ensures settlement (by reserving the pre-funded balance of the Destination PSP or otherwise).

6

The Destination IPS forwards the payment message to the Destination PSP for validation.

7

The **Destination PSP** will apply sanctions screening and compliance checks and validate the Recipients account.

8

The Destination PSP sends a confirmation to the Destination IPS in the form of a pacs.002 message

9

The Destination IPS sends a Nexus pacs.002 message to the Nexus Destination Gateway

The Destination IPS must use the Nexus pacs.002 payment status report format to confirm the transaction to the Nexus Gateway. See [Messaging & Translation](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/key-points)
for details on the format.

10

The Destination Nexus Gateway confirms receipt with a Nexus pacs.002 and stops the timer.

11

Upon confirmation of the Nexus Gateway, the D-IPS will finalize the settlement of the transaction.

It is essential in High Priority payments that the Destination IPS ensures settlement is subject to the confirmation of this Nexus pacs.002.

12

The D-IPS will confirm settlement to the Destination SAP and the Destination PSP.

13

The Destination SAP can now finalize the debit on the FXP account.

14

Upon receiving confirmation of settlement, the Destination PSP credits the Recipient.

15

In case the Destination PSP is not able to credit the Recipient, the Destination PSP will send a pacs.002 reject back to the Destination IPS.

16

The Destination IPS will inform the Destination Nexus Gateway of the reject by sending a Nexus pacs.002.

17

The Nexus Destination Gateway will confirm receipt of the Nexus pacs.002.

The Destination IPS can await the confirmation by the Nexus Gateway, but as in this case the payment is rejected, the Destination IPS is also allowed to proceed with the next steps pending the response from the Nexus Gateway.

18

Upon receiving the reject confirmation from the Nexus Gateway, the Destination IPS will reverse the settlement reservation.

19

The Destination IPS will inform the Destination SAP and the Destination PSP of the reject by sending pacs.002 messages.

20

Upon receiving the pacs.002 rejection from the Destination IPS, the Destination SAP will release the reservation on the FXPs account.

21

In the scenario there is a failure in the Destination processing (either in the Destination IPS, SAP or PSP), a pacs.002 confirming or rejecting the payment may not arrive at the Destination IPS.

22

Specifically for High Priority payments, thr Nexus Gateway will keep a timer and reject the payment when the maximum time has exceeded. The Nexus Gateway will send a Nexus pacs.002 reject to the Destination IPS.

23

Upon receiving the reject message from the Nexus Gateway, the Destination IPS will reverse the settlement reservation.

The Destination IPS needs to ensure settlement is subject to the Nexus pacs.002 from the Nexus Gateway. Even in the case a positive response has been received from the Destination PSP, the payment may still be rejected in case the pacs.002 has not been received by the Nexus Gateway in time.

24

The Destination IPS will inform the Destination SAP and the Destination PSP of the reject by sending pacs.002 messages.

25

Upon receiving the pacs.002 rejection from the Destination IPS, the Destination SAP will release the reservation on the FXPs account.

# How the Destination IPS initiates the payment via the Destination SAP | Nexus Payments Docs

circle-info

When Nexus sends a payment instruction to the Destination IPS, the Destination IPS must send that to the Destination SAP. Nexus does not prescribe the process by which the Destination IPS sends the Nexus payment instruction to the Destination SAP; this is the responsibility of the Destination IPS. Possible options are described below.

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap/how-the-destination-ips-initiates-the-payment-via-the-destination-sap#requirements-for-submission-of-payment-instructions-to-the-destination-sap)

Requirements for submission of payment instructions to the Destination SAP


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nexus does have a set of minimum requirements regarding this process to ensure that Nexus remains fair, safe, efficient, transparent and open.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap/how-the-destination-ips-initiates-the-payment-via-the-destination-sap#open-and-fair)

**Open and fair**

*   The payment initiation process towards D-SAPs:
    
    *   should be capable of supporting multiple SAPs and should not be designed specifically for a single SAP
        
    *   should be open to any PSP eligible to be an SAP and any PSP which adheres to the Nexus requirements for an SAP
        
    *   must not be limited to specific currency pairs or specific corridors. It should not restrict SAPs to provide services to FXPs for other/additional currencies
        
    *   should be designed to minimize the development, implementation and operational impact on PSPs performing the role of SAP
        
    
*   SAPs providing services to an FXP should not be limited to providing services to other FXPs for different or the same currency pairs
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap/how-the-destination-ips-initiates-the-payment-via-the-destination-sap#use-of-standards)

**Use of standards**

*   The payment initiation process towards D-SAPs should reuse existing domestic standard messages or industry standard messages where possible to minimize impact on PSPs, IPSs and SAPs
    
*   The payment initiation process towards D-SAPs must support real-time payment processing and not introduce delays
    

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap/how-the-destination-ips-initiates-the-payment-via-the-destination-sap#minimizing-risks)

**Minimizing risks**

*   The payment initiation process towards D-SAPs should not introduce settlement risks. Settlement should be guaranteed and not be reversible.
    
*   The payment initiation process towards D-SAPs should not introduce credit risks towards the FXP, unless otherwise agreed between the SAP and the FXP. For example, a balance check on the account of the FXP upon executing a payment should not be skipped unless there is an agreement in place to provide a line of credit.

Possible payment initiation methods


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the D-SAP, the submission of the payment instruction from Nexus or Destination IPS to the Destination SAP can be done in multiple ways. The Destination IPS is free to implement one of more of the presented models, as well as design their own model.

### 

[hashtag](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/settlement-access-provision/processing-payments-as-an-sap/how-the-destination-ips-initiates-the-payment-via-the-destination-sap#toc163730759)

Method 1: Payment initiation via Nexus in a pacs.008 message

Upon receiving the payment from the Source Nexus Gateway, the Nexus Gateway forwards the received `pacs.008` as a payment initiation request to the D-SAP (via the Destination IPS), to be processed by the D-SAP. In this scenario, the D-SAP treats the FXP as a financial institution to which it provides settlement services.

*   After the processing in the Source IPS has completed its first phase, it sends the Nexus `pacs.008` to the Nexus Gateway.
    
*   The Nexus Gateway sends the Nexus `pacs.008` to the Destination IPS.
    
*   The Destination IPS validates the received Nexus `pacs.008` and (upon successful validation) initiates the payment towards the Destination SAP in a `pacs.008` (either in Nexus format or enhanced domestic format) message.
    
    *   The D-SAP is able to recognize that it is playing the role of D-SAP because the D-SAP is not identified as Creditor Agent, but as Instructing Agent (in the Nexus `pacs.008` format).
        
    
*   The D-SAP validates the message, validates the identified FXP account and if successful, initiates the destination process of Nexus by sending a `pacs.008` message (or domestic equivalent) to the D-IPS. The D-IPS will then process this instruction by making the transfer from D-SAP to D-PSP
    
    *   Depending on the process as designed by the D-IPS, a `pacs.002` confirming or rejecting the original `pacs.008` message from the D-IPS can also be used.

_Implications for the D-SAP_

*   The D-SAP must be able to receive a `pacs.008` instruction and process the `pacs.008` similar to a payment initiation request, including payment, account and compliance validations, debit authorization and booking.
    
*   Depending on the requirements of the D-IPS, the D-SAP either responds to the `pacs.008` by initiating the domestic processing to the D-IPS (in a `pacs.008` or domestic format message) or acknowledges the Nexus `pacs.008` with a `pacs.002` with code `ACTC`, followed by the initiation of the domestic processing.
    
*   The D-SAP should be able to reconcile the result of the settlement back to the payment instruction.

Method 2a: Debit Authorization via message or API

In this setup, the D-IPS receives the Nexus `pacs.008`, and then prepares a debit authorization request which it sends to the D-SAP, via an API call or an ISO20022 `camt.103 Create Reservation` message. The request specifies the amount to be debited, the account details for the FXP, and an ID that can be reconciled with the IPS’s settlement report.

*   After the processing in the Source IPS has completed its first phase, the Source Nexus Gateway sends the Nexus `pacs.008` to the Destination Nexus Gateway. The Nexus Gateway has two options:
    
    *   In option 1, the Nexus Gateway sends the Nexus `pacs.008` to the Destination IPS. The D-IPS initiates a debit authorization request to the D-SAP.
        
    *   In option 2, the Nexus Gateway initiates the debit authorization request directly to the D-SAP.
        
    
*   The D-SAP validates the account and the available funds on the FXPs account at the D-SAP.
    
*   The D-SAP can accept or reject the request.
    
    *   In option 1, in case of a positive response, the D-IPS initiates the domestic payment process by sending a `pacs.008` to the D-PSP.
        
    *   In option 2, the D-SAP responds to the Nexus Gateway, and the Nexus Gateway initiates the domestic payment process by sending the `pacs.008` to the D-IPS, and the D-IPS sends the `pacs.008` to the D-PSP.
        
    
*   The D-SAP ultimately receives the detailed payment information through the settlement report from the D-IPS.

_Implications for the D-SAP_

*   The D-SAP must be able to receive and respond to a debit authorization request via API and should be able to make a funds reservation on the FXP’s account as a result of the request.
    
*   The D-SAP must be able to reconcile the `pacs.002` and the settlement report with the debit authorization/funds reservation on the FXP's account and with the settlement of the transaction.
    

circle-exclamation

The D-SAP **must also be able to rely on the compliance screening done by the D-PSP**, as the D-SAP does not receive the full payment information until after settlement.

Whether the D-SAP is willing to rely on the compliance screening done by the D-PSP will depend on local regulations and market practice. However, the fact that the D-SAP does not see the full payment information until after the payment has been completed may mean that Method 2a is not acceptable in a number of jursidictions.

2b. Payment Initiation via API with full payment information

Expanding on the debit authorization method 2a (above), in this model the Nexus Gateway or the Destination IPS (depending on the setup preference) sends a full payment initiation request to the D-SAP via API.

This method is very similar to method 2a of sending a debit authorization via API, with the added benefit of making the full payment information available to the D-SAP.

*   After the processing in the Source IPS has completed its first phase, the Source IPS sends the Nexus `pacs.008` to the Nexus Gateway.
    
*   The Nexus Gateway sends the pacs.008 to the D-IPS.
    
*   The D-IPS initiates the payment towards the D-SAP by sending the full payment information via a payment initiation API exposes by the D-SAP.
    
*   This allows the D-SAP to perform a full compliance validation on the payment, before confirming the payment.
    

To confirm the payment, the D-SAP has two options:

*   Option 1: the D-SAP confirms the payment by initiating a `pacs.008` to the D-IPS, or
    
*   Option 2: the D-SAP confirms the payment by sending an acceptance status to the API and subsequently, the D-IPS forwards the `pacs.008` message originally sent from Nexus.

_Implications for the D-SAP_

Depending on the option chosen, the D-SAP must be able to receive a payment instruction via API, perform the required validations (including, if required by local legislation, compliance checks) and:

*   respond to the API call and reconcile the `pacs.002` and settlement report back to the payment instruction
    
*   initiate the local settlement via a `pacs.008`. The D-SAP should be able to reconcile the local settlement with the payment initiation instruction, depending on their requirements

Method 3. Payment Initiation a pain.001 message

In this method, the payment is initiated as a corporate payment by the D-IPS submitting a `**pain.001 Customer Credit Transfer Initiation**` message to the D-IPS via the corporate channel of the D-SAP. This allows the D-SAP to reuse an existing payment initiation process that they provide to corporates. They may still need to recognize this as a Nexus payment for compliance reasons, depending on local legislation.

_Process_

*   After the processing in the Source IPS has completed its first phase, the Source IPS sends the Nexus `pacs.008` to the Nexus Gateway.
    
*   The Nexus Gateway sends the `pacs.008` to the D-IPS.
    
*   The D-IPS initiates the domestic process by sending a `pain.001` message to the corporate channel of the D-SAP. After receiving the pain.001 message, the D-SAP must perform all required validations and compliance checks, debit the FXP’s account and initiate the local settlement via a pacs.008 message to the D-IPS.
    

The D-IPS will need to correlate the `pacs.008` received from Nexus with the `pacs.008` received from the D-SAP, as the `pain.001` cannot contain all the information from the pacs.008 received from Nexus. The following fields cannot be transported in a `pain.001` (which are present in the Nexus `pacs.008` message):

_Consequences for the D-SAP_

*   The D-SAP must open up its corporate channel for payment initiation coming from the Nexus Gateway or D-IPS. This means that the `pain.001` serves the same purposes as a payment instruction coming directly from the FXP (i.e. the FXP telling its PSP to debit its account and initiate a payment towards the Receiver).

_Consequences for the D-IPS_

*   The D-IPS must correlate the `pacs.008` received from the D-SAP with the `pacs.008` from the Nexus Gateway to enrich the payment with the additional information which cannot be carried in the `pain.001`.

Payment Status Reason codes

Reason codes are taken from the [ISO 20022 External Code Setarrow-up-right](https://www.iso20022.org/catalogue-messages/additional-content-messages/external-code-sets)
. The code set to be used for errors is the **ExternalStatusReason1Code.**

circle-exclamation

**Translation of error codes:** Nexus does not prescribe a specific message format for the interaction between the IPS and its Participants. Where an IPS uses a different error code list domestically, it is the responsibility of the IPSO to map their domestic error codes onto the ISO 20022 codes while keeping the highest level of detail. See [Translation To/From Domestic Message Formats](https://docs.nexusglobalpayments.org/messaging-and-translation/translation-to-from-domestic-message-formats)
